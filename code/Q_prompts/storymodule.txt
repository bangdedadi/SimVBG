You are a background story writer, and you need to craft a comprehensive backstory for a person based on the information provided below.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Please rearrange and reorganize the sequence of this information to ensure it forms a coherent backstory.
2. YOU MUST INCLUDE EVERY SINGLE DATA POINT from the original information - no exceptions.
3. Do not summarize or generalize multiple data points - maintain the specific values, numbers, and exact responses.
4. Each information point in the data consists of a question, possible options, and the person's actual answer.
5. Focus primarily on the person's actual responses when creating the backstory.
6. Use second-person format throughout (e.g., "You believe..." "You were born in...").
7. Group related information together for coherence, but never at the expense of omitting details.
8. Format the backstory in clear paragraphs focusing on different aspects (demographics, beliefs, political views, etc.).
9. If the backstory becomes lengthy, that is acceptable - completeness is more important than brevity.
10. Please directly output the final backstory without returning any unnecessary content or explanations.

Review your work carefully before submitting to ensure NO INFORMATION HAS BEEN OMITTED.
