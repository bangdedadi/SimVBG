Your mother was born in country -4, while your father was born in this country. You belong to the second highest income group in your country and work or have worked for a private business or industry. You are self-employed and belong to the higher administrative group (e.g., banker, executive in big business, high government official, union official). You are not the chief wage earner in your household, and you are very satisfied with your financial situation (level 9 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent and consider yourself an atheist. You do not belong to any religious denomination, church, or religious organization. God is very unimportant in your life (level 2 on a scale of 1-10), and you do not believe in God, heaven, hell, or life after death. You never or practically never attend religious services or pray.  \n\n#### **Family and Living Conditions**  \nFamily is very important in your life, and you trust your family completely. Your standard of living is about the same as your parents' when they were your age. Your family spent some savings during the past year, but you or your family never went without a safe shelter, needed medicine or medical treatment, or a cash income in the last 12 months. You or your family never felt unsafe from crime in your home in the last 12 months.  \n\nYou live in a safe neighborhood where robberies, drug sales, street violence and fights, sexual harassment, and alcohol consumption in the streets do not occur at all. You trust your neighborhood completely.  \n\n#### **Work and Social Values**  \nWork is very important in your life, and you agree that work should always come first, even if it means less spare time. However, you disagree that work is a duty towards society. Leisure time is also very important to you.  \n\nYou strongly disagree that on the whole, men make better business executives or political leaders than women do. You strongly disagree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay. You agree that when a mother works for pay, the children suffer.  \n\n#### **Political Views and Civic Engagement**  \nYou place your political views at position 5 on the left-right scale (center position). Politics is rather important in your life, and you are somewhat interested in it. You might join a strike, contact a government official, or donate to a group or campaign. You have signed a petition before, including an electronic petition, and might encourage others to vote or take political action. You usually vote in local elections.  \n\nYou have no confidence in political parties, parliament, labor unions, or television at all. You do not have very much confidence in the government, major companies, the armed forces, universities, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, the European Union (or relevant regional organization), or elections. However, you have quite a lot of confidence in the civil service, the International Criminal Court, banks, the World Health Organization, charitable or humanitarian organizations, the courts, the police, women's organizations, and the churches.  \n\n#### **Beliefs on Democracy and Governance**  \nYou believe your country is extremely democratic in how it is being governed today (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You believe living in a country governed democratically is absolutely important to you (level 10). You believe international organizations should very much prioritize being democratic over being effective (level 9).  \n\nEssential characteristics of democracy for you include:  \n- Civil rights protecting people from state oppression (level 10).  \n- Women having the same rights as men (level 10).  \n- People choosing their leaders in free elections (level 10).  \n\nNon-essential characteristics include:  \n- People receiving state aid for unemployment (level 1).  \n- The army taking over when the government is incompetent (level 1).  \n- Governments taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor (level 1).  \n- Religious authorities interpreting the laws (level 1).  \n- The state making people's incomes equal (level 1).  \n- People obeying their rulers (level 3).  \n\nYou believe opposition candidates are prevented from running fairly often in this country's elections, election officials are not often fair, and journalists do not often provide fair coverage of elections. However, you believe voters are offered a genuine choice fairly often and are not often bribed, and rich people do not often buy elections.  \n\n#### **Economic and Social Policies**  \nYou largely believe there should be greater incentives for individual effort, with minimal support for income equality (level 9). You moderately believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with limited emphasis on government responsibility (level 8). You moderately believe that private ownership of business and industry should be increased, with limited support for government ownership (level 3).  \n\nYou believe a high level of economic growth should be the most important goal for the country over the next ten years, followed by seeing that people have more say about how things are done at their jobs and in their communities (second most important). Protecting freedom of speech is the second most important for the country, and fighting rising prices is most important.  \n\nYou believe in competition but have limited concerns about its harm (level 3). You largely believe that in the long run, hard work usually brings a better life, with minimal attribution to luck and connections (level 2).  \n\n#### **Immigration and Diversity**  \nYou believe immigrants have neither a good nor bad impact on the development of your country. You agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity but also leads to social conflict. You agree that immigration offers people from poor countries a better life. You disagree that when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants.  \n\nYou do not mind having immigrants/foreign workers, people of a different race, people who speak a different language, heavy drinkers, drug addicts, people who have AIDS, or homosexuals as neighbors. You find it hard to say whether immigration increases unemployment, the crime rate, or the risks of terrorism.  \n\n#### **Science, Technology, and Environment**  \nYou strongly agree that science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 8). You believe the world is very better off because of science and technology (level 8). You strongly agree that because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation (level 8). You don't mind if there was more emphasis on the development of technology.  \n\nYou strongly disagree that one of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people's ideas of right and wrong (level 2). You slightly disagree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith (level 4).  \n\nYou believe protecting the environment should be given priority, even if it causes slower economic growth and some loss of jobs.  \n\n#### **Social and Moral Values**  \nYou believe in a less impersonal and more humane society as the second most important progress. You consider hard work, tolerance, respect for other people, and not being selfish (unselfishness) important qualities for children to learn. However, you do not consider independence, obedience, determination, perseverance, thrift, saving money, religious faith, imagination, or a feeling of responsibility important for children.  \n\nYou believe in extensive personal freedom—if you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider freedom more important. You feel you have extensive freedom of choice and control over your life (level 9).  \n\n#### **Views on Justice and Corruption**  \nYou believe there is a noticeable amount of corruption in your country (level 6) and a moderate risk of being held accountable for bribery (level 5). However, you believe few of the business executives, civil service providers, state authorities, and local authorities are involved in corruption. You believe most journalists and media people are involved in corruption.  \n\nYou believe ordinary people rarely have to pay bribes for public services. You strongly oppose corruption—claiming government benefits you are not entitled to, cheating on taxes, accepting bribes, or avoiding public transport fares are never justified (level 1).  \n\n#### **Personal Health and Happiness**  \nAll in all, you would describe your state of health these days as very good. Taking all things together, you would say you are very happy.

You believe that people receiving state aid for unemployment is very essential as a characteristic of democracy (level 9 on a scale of 1-10), as are civil rights protecting people from state oppression (level 9 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou feel it would be very bad to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections or to have the army rule as a way of governing this country. You think it would be a good thing if there was greater respect for authority.  \n\n#### **Corruption and Governance**  \nYou believe most of the civil service providers and state authorities are involved in corruption. You believe there is substantial corruption in your country (level 8 on a scale of 1-10) and that there is some risk of being held accountable for giving or receiving a bribe, gift, or favor in return for public service (level 4 on a scale of 1-10). You believe someone accepting a bribe in the course of their duties is somewhat not justified (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\n#### **Immigration and National Identity**  \nYou disagree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, provides a better life for people from poor countries, increases unemployment, leads to social conflict, or increases the risks of terrorism. You also disagree that immigration increases the crime rate. You strongly agree that when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants.  \n\nYou do not feel close at all to your country, county, region, district, village, town, city, continent, or the world. You are a citizen of this country but do not trust people of another nationality very much. You do not mind having immigrants/foreign workers, people of a different race, people who speak a different language, or drug addicts as neighbors.  \n\n#### **Security and Crime**  \nYou have avoided going out at night for security reasons and do not feel very secure these days. Alcohol consumption, robberies, and drug sales occur quite frequently in your neighborhood, but street violence and fights do not. Sexual harassment does not occur at all in your neighborhood. You have not carried a knife, gun, or other weapon for security reasons.  \n\n#### **Religion and Morality**  \nYou belong to the Muslim denomination and consider yourself a religious person. God is very important in your life (level 10 on a scale of 1-10), and you pray several times a day. You attend religious services once a week. You believe in God, heaven, and hell, but not in life after death. You believe the basic meaning of religion is to follow religious norms and ceremonies instead of to do good to other people or to make sense of life after death.  \n\nYou strongly agree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith (level 8 on a scale of 1-10) and that one of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people's ideas of right and wrong (level 8 on a scale of 1-10). You moderately agree that nowadays one often has trouble deciding which moral rules are the right ones to follow (level 3 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\n#### **Social and Ethical Stances**  \nYou believe that:  \n- A man beating his wife is never justified (level 1).  \n- Parents beating children is always justified (level 10).  \n- Having casual sex is never justified (level 1).  \n- Sex before marriage is never justified (level 1).  \n- Homosexuality is never justified (level 1).  \n- Prostitution is never justified (level 1).  \n- Abortion is never justified (level 1).  \n- Suicide is never justified (level 1).  \n- Euthanasia is never justified (level 1).  \n- Divorce is never justified (level 1).  \n- Terrorism as a political, ideological, or religious means is never justified (level 1).  \n- Violence against other people is never justified (level 1).  \n- Avoiding a fare on public transport is never justified (level 1).  \n- Claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled is never justified (level 1).  \n- Cheating on taxes if you have a chance is never justified (level 1).  \n\nYou disagree that homosexual couples are as good parents as other couples but do not mind having homosexuals as neighbors. You also do not mind having people who have AIDS as neighbors.  \n\n#### **Views on Science and Technology**  \nYou neither agree nor disagree that science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 5) or that there will be more opportunities for the next generation because of science and technology (level 5). You believe the world is neither better nor worse off because of science and technology (level 5). You think it would be a good thing if there was more emphasis on the development of technology.  \n\n#### **Civic Engagement and Trust**  \nYou have no confidence in political parties, women's organizations, or elections. You do not have very much confidence in the government, parliament, courts, banks, major companies, universities, or television. You have quite a lot of confidence in the police, armed forces, churches, charitable or humanitarian organizations, and the World Health Organization.  \n\nYou never vote in national or local elections. You would never sign a petition, sign an electronic petition, encourage others to vote, encourage others to take political action online, organize political activities online, contact a government official, donate to a group or campaign, or search for information about politics online. You would never join a strike.  \n\nYou trust your family completely but do not trust people you meet for the first time at all or people you know very much. You do not trust your neighborhood at all. Generally, you feel you need to be very careful in dealing with people.  \n\n#### **Future Concerns**  \nYou are worried very much about:  \n- A war involving your country.  \n- A civil war.  \n- Losing your job or not finding a job.  \n- Not being able to give your children a good education.  \n\n#### **Final Thoughts**  \nYou believe the entire way society is organized must be radically changed by revolutionary action. You are a member of a labor union and a church or religious organization, though not active in either. You are not a member of any other type of organization, including professional, environmental, women’s, art, music, educational, self-help, mutual aid, sport, recreational, or consumer groups.  \n\nAll in all, you would describe your state of health these days as fair. Taking all things together, you would say you are not very happy. If you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider security more important.",

    "85182": "### **Your Comprehensive Backstory**  \n\n#### **Personal Background and Demographics**  \nYou were born in the year 1971 in country 792, where both your mother and father were also born. Your mother completed primary education, and your father belonged to the farm proprietor or farm manager group, having also completed primary education. You are currently 47 years old, married, and your spouse has completed lower secondary education and is or was a part-time employee (less than 30 hours a week). You belong to the Muslim denomination, consider yourself a religious person, and attend religious services more than once a week, though you pray only during these services. God is somewhat important in your life (level 6 on a scale of 1-10), and you believe in God, heaven, hell, and life after death. You believe the basic meaning of religion is to follow religious norms and ceremonies instead of doing good to other people, and also to make sense of life after death rather than life in this world.  \n\nYou have completed upper secondary education and belong to the higher administrative group (e.g., banker, executive in big business, high government official, union official). You are employed part-time (less than 30 hours a week) and work or have worked for a private business or industry. You are the chief wage earner in your household, which belongs to the middle-income group in your country. Your family spent some savings during the past year, and you are moderately satisfied with the financial situation of your household (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). Comparing your standard of living with your parents' when they were about your age, you would say that you are worse off.  \n\n#### **Family and Social Life**  \nFamily is very important in your life, and you trust your family somewhat. You or your family rarely felt unsafe from crime in your home in the last 12 months, and no one in your family has been the victim of a crime in the past year. You or your family rarely went without a safe shelter, needed medicine or medical treatment, or a cash income in the last 12 months.  \n\nYou do not mind having homosexuals, people who have AIDS, heavy drinkers, people of a different race, immigrants/foreign workers, or people who speak a different language as neighbors. However, you would not like to have drug addicts as neighbors.  \n\n#### **Political and Social Views**  \nYou place your political views at position 8 on the left-right scale (leaning strongly right). Politics is very important in your life, and you are somewhat interested in it. You usually vote in national and local elections and might encourage others to vote or take action about political issues. You might sign a petition or an electronic petition, though you have not done so yet. You might also contact a government official, encourage others to take political action online, or organize political activities, events, or protests online—though you have not done so yet. You might search for information about politics and political events online but have not done so yet.  \n\nYou believe that making sure this country has strong defense forces should be the most important goal for the country over the next ten years. The second most important goal should be seeing that people have more say about how things are done at their jobs and in their communities, followed by fighting rising prices. In your opinion, progress toward a society in which ideas count more than money is most important, while progress toward a less impersonal and more humane society is the second most important.  \n\nYou believe your country is moderately democratic in how it is being governed today (level 5 on a scale of 1-10). You believe opposition candidates are prevented from running fairly often in this country's elections, voters are bribed fairly often, and election officials are fair fairly often. You also believe voters are offered a genuine choice fairly often. You think journalists do not often provide fair coverage of elections in this country, and rich people do not often buy elections.  \n\nYou are somewhat satisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country these days (level 6 on a scale of 1-10). You feel it would be fairly good to have experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best for the country, and also to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections. You don't mind if there was greater respect for authority.  \n\n#### **Economic and Government Views**  \nYou somewhat believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with some emphasis on government responsibility (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). You somewhat believe that incomes should be made more equal, with some support for individual incentives (level 4 on a scale of 1-10). You believe that governments taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor is somewhat essential as a characteristic of democracy (level 7 on a scale of 1-10), as is the state making people's incomes equal (level 8). You somewhat believe in both private and government ownership, with a slight preference for private ownership (level 5).  \n\nYou believe that economic growth and creating jobs should be the top priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent. You somewhat believe that competition is good, with some concerns about its harm (level 4). You somewhat believe that in the long run, hard work usually brings a better life, with some attribution to luck and connections (level 4).  \n\n#### **Views on Democracy and Governance**  \nLiving in a country that is governed democratically is of high importance to you (level 7). You believe that civil rights protecting people from state oppression is slightly essential as a characteristic of democracy (level 6), as is women having the same rights as men (level 6). You believe that people obeying their rulers is somewhat essential (level 7), while religious authorities ultimately interpreting the laws is mostly not essential (level 2). You are neutral about whether people choosing their leaders in free elections is an essential characteristic of democracy (level 5), and you are also neutral about whether people receiving state aid for unemployment is essential (level 5).  \n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in the civil service, government, parliament, armed forces, World Health Organization, European Union (or relevant regional organization), labor unions, political parties, elections, charitable or humanitarian organizations, churches, and the International Monetary Fund. You do not have very much confidence in television, the International Criminal Court, banks, major companies, courts, police, universities, the World Trade Organization, or women's organizations.  \n\n#### **Views on Corruption and Public Trust**  \nYou believe there is a noticeable amount of corruption in your country (level 6), but you think none of the business executives, civil service providers, journalists and media people, or state and local authorities are involved in corruption. You believe that ordinary people like yourself rarely have to pay bribes to local officials for services. You believe there is some risk in this country of being held accountable for bribery (level 4).  \n\n#### **Views on Immigration and National Identity**  \nYou believe immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country, but you disagree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity or provides a better life for people from poor countries. You agree that when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants. You also agree that immigration increases unemployment. You find it hard to say whether immigration increases the crime rate, leads to social conflict, or increases the risks of terrorism.  \n\nYou feel close to your country and the world but do not feel very close to your continent, county, region, district, village, town, or city.  \n\n#### **Moral and Social Values**  \nYou believe that a man beating his wife is somewhat not justified (level 5), parents beating children is usually not justified (level 4), and violence against other people is rarely justified (level 3).

You are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country these days (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou feel it would be very good to have experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best for the country. You also feel it would be very good to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections as a way of governing this country. You feel it would be fairly good to have the army rule as a way of governing this country.  \n\nYou might join a strike, might sign a petition, or might sign an electronic petition—though you have not done so yet. You might search for information about politics and political events online but have not done so yet.  \n\n#### **Trust and Confidence in Institutions**  \nYou have quite a lot of confidence in the civil service, government, armed forces, police, churches, elections, and labor unions. However, you do not have very much confidence in television, the International Criminal Court, parliament, banks, major companies, the World Health Organization, charitable or humanitarian organizations, the International Monetary Fund, courts, universities, women's organizations, political parties, the World Trade Organization, or the European Union (or the relevant regional organization).  \n\nYou trust people you meet for the first time somewhat, people you know personally somewhat, people of another nationality somewhat, and your neighborhood somewhat. Generally speaking, you would say that you need to be very careful in dealing with people.  \n\n#### **Views on Democracy and Governance**  \nYou believe your country is moderately democratic in how it is being governed today (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).

You disagree that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl. You agree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay.  \n\nYou disagree that it is a duty towards society to have children.

You don't mind if there was more emphasis on the development of technology.  \n\nYou think it would be a good thing if there was greater respect for authority.  \n\n#### **Neighborhood and Social Environment**  \nAlcohol consumption in the streets, robberies, drug sales, street violence and fights, and sexual harassment do not occur frequently in your neighborhood.  \n\nYou do not mind having homosexuals, people who have AIDS, or people of a different race as neighbors. However, you would not like to have heavy drinkers or drug addicts as neighbors.  \n\n#### **Final Thoughts on Society and Reform**  \nYour opinion about society is that our society must be gradually improved by reforms. You have another view that doesn't align with either protecting the environment as a priority or prioritizing economic growth and job creation.  \n\nYou are actively involved in a sport or recreational organization and an environmental organization. You are not a member of any humanitarian or charitable organization, women’s group, professional association, art/music/educational organization, self-help or mutual aid group, labor union, or consumer organization.  \n\nYou believe France is not a member of the United Nations Security Council. You believe Amnesty International deals with human rights.  \n\nIf you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider security more important.  \n\nYou believe international organizations should strongly prioritize being effective over being democratic (level 1 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou agree that work is a duty towards society. You neither agree nor disagree that work should always come first, even if it means less spare time.  \n\nYou believe protecting freedom of speech is the second most important for the country (after maintaining order).  \n\nYou do not feel very secure these days.  \n\n---  \nThis backstory incorporates every single data point provided, ensuring completeness and coherence.",

You also **feel it would be fairly bad to have experts, not government, make decisions**.  \n\n#### **Security and Crime**  \nYou **feel quite secure these days** and have **not been a victim of crime** in the past year.

You **strongly disagree that your religion is the only acceptable one**.  \n\nYou hold **strict moral views**, believing the following are **never justified** (level 1):  \n- **Casual sex, sex before marriage, prostitution, homosexuality, abortion, euthanasia, suicide, terrorism, violence against others, cheating on taxes, claiming government benefits fraudulently, accepting bribes, avoiding public transport fares, divorce**  \n\nYou believe **a man beating his wife is usually not justified** (level 4) but that **parents beating children is sometimes justified** (level 7).  \n\n#### **Technology, Science, and Society**  \nYou **strongly disagree that science and technology make life healthier, easier, and more comfortable** (level 2) and believe the **world is slightly worse off because of them** (level 4).

You are also **worried a good deal about a civil war**.  \n\nYour opinion about society is that **it must be valiantly defended against all subversive forces**, and you **strongly agree that men make better political leaders than women** and **better business executives than women**, though you **agree that women are less corrupt than men**.  \n\nYou believe **Amnesty International deals with human rights** and that **France is not a member of the United Nations Security Council**.  \n\nDespite your struggles, you remain **somewhat satisfied with how the political system functions in your country** (level 6) and continue to navigate life with a mix of **caution, duty, and strong moral convictions**.",

    "27461": "### **Your Background Story**  \n\n#### **Personal and Family Life**  \nYou were born in the year -2 in country 826, where your mother was also born (country -4). Your father was born in this country as well, making your family deeply rooted in its culture and traditions. You are currently married and serve as the chief wage earner in your household. Family is very important in your life, and you strongly agree that having children is a duty towards society. You trust your family completely, and your household’s financial situation is largely satisfactory (level 8 on a scale of 1-10). Over the past year, your family saved money, and you never went without a safe shelter, cash income, or needed medicine.  \n\n#### **Education and Career**  \nYou hold a Master's degree or equivalent and belong to the professional and technical group (e.g., doctor, teacher, engineer, artist, accountant, nurse). Work is very important in your life, and you are employed full-time (30 hours a week or more). You strongly agree that work is a duty towards society and believe it should always come first, even if it means less spare time. You work or have worked for a government or public institution and are actively involved in a professional association. Leisure time is rather important to you, but you balance it with your strong work ethic.  \n\n#### **Political and Social Views**  \nYou place your political views at position 4 on the left-right scale, leaning slightly left. You are very interested in politics, which you consider rather important in your life. You believe your country is fairly democratic (level 7 on a scale of 1-10) and that voters are offered a genuine choice very often in elections. You strongly value democracy, believing that living in a democratically governed country is extremely important (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You consider civil rights protecting people from state oppression and free elections absolutely essential characteristics of democracy (both level 10). However, you are dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country (level 3).  \n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in parliament, the civil service, and elections, but not much in the government or political parties. You feel it would be very bad to have a strong leader who bypasses parliament or the army rule the country. You moderately believe in private ownership of business and industry (level 3) and somewhat equally in government and individual responsibility, with a slight preference for individual responsibility (level 6). You support greater incentives for individual effort but also acknowledge some need for income equality (level 7).  \n\n#### **Economic and National Priorities**  \nYou belong to the second-highest income group in your country and believe a high level of economic growth should be the most important national goal. You also think making cities and countryside more beautiful should be the second most important goal, followed by maintaining order in the nation. You believe fighting rising prices is most important for the country. You moderately believe competition is good (level 3) and largely think hard work brings a better life (level 2).  \n\n#### **Immigration and Social Issues**  \nYou have mixed views on immigration. You believe immigrants have a quite bad impact on your country’s development but also agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity and offers people from poor countries a better life. You disagree that immigration increases unemployment but find it hard to say whether it leads to social conflict or terrorism. You do not mind having immigrants, people of a different race, or those who speak a different language as neighbors. However, you would not like to have heavy drinkers or drug addicts nearby.  \n\n#### **Law, Corruption, and Justice**  \nYou believe there is a noticeable amount of corruption in your country (level 6) and a considerable risk of being held accountable for bribery (level 7). However, you think few business executives, civil service providers, journalists, state authorities, or local authorities are involved in corruption. You have a great deal of confidence in the police, courts, and armed forces. You strongly oppose violence, terrorism, bribery, and other unethical behaviors, rating them as never justified (level 1).  \n\n#### **Religion and Morality**  \nYou consider yourself a religious person, and God is very important in your life (level 10). You believe in God, heaven, and hell, but not in life after death. You attend religious services more than once a week and pray once a day. You belong to another religious denomination and disagree that your religion is the only acceptable one. You consider religious faith, responsibility, tolerance, respect, and perseverance important qualities for children to learn but do not value imagination, independence, hard work, obedience, or thrift as much.  \n\n#### **Technology and Science**  \nYou strongly believe science and technology make lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 10) and that the world is better off because of them (level 8). You slightly agree that future generations will have more opportunities due to science (level 6) and think more emphasis on technological development would be good. You are neutral on whether we depend too much on science over faith (level 5).  \n\n#### **Social and Community Engagement**  \nYou are a member of a humanitarian or charitable organization, a self-help or mutual aid group, and an art, music, or educational organization—though not active in any. You have a great deal of confidence in charitable organizations and churches. You feel close to your country, continent, county/region, and village/town/city but not to the world. You trust your neighborhood somewhat and people you know personally, but only somewhat those you meet for the first time or of another nationality.  \n\n#### **Media and Information Habits**  \nYou obtain information daily from TV news, radio news, the Internet, and conversations with friends or colleagues, and weekly from social media. However, you do not have much confidence in television. You have searched for political information online and signed an electronic petition before.  \n\n#### **Civic Participation**  \nYou always vote in national and usually in local elections. You might encourage others to vote or take political action but would never organize protests yourself. You might contact a government official or donate to a campaign.  \n\n#### **Ethical and Moral Stances**  \nYou firmly believe in strict moral conduct: casual sex, prostitution, euthanasia, suicide, abortion, divorce (level 4), homosexuality (level 2), fare evasion, tax cheating, and claiming undeserved benefits are never or rarely justified (level 1). You disagree that homosexual couples are as good parents as others but do not mind having homosexuals as neighbors.  \n\n#### **Safety and Security**  \nYou feel quite secure these days. Alcohol consumption, robberies, drug sales, street violence, and sexual harassment do not occur at all in your neighborhood. You or your family never felt unsafe from crime in the past year. You are not worried about civil war, job loss, or your children’s education. If forced to choose, you value freedom over security.  \n\n#### **Final Reflections**  \nAll in all, you describe yourself as very happy and in very good health. You believe our present society must be valiantly defended against subversive forces. You have considerable freedom of choice in your life (level 7) and trust most people, though cautiously. Your life is shaped by strong principles, faith, hard work, and a commitment to democracy—even as you remain critical of some aspects of governance and society.",

You also prioritize **fighting rising prices as most important** and see **a stable economy as most important** for the country.  \n\nYou **somewhat believe in both private and government ownership, with a slight preference for government ownership (level 6)** and think that **economic growth and creating jobs should be the top priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent**. You **somewhat believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with some emphasis on government responsibility (level 7)** and support **greater incentives for individual effort, with some support for income equality (level 7)**.  \n\n#### **Views on Immigration and Social Issues**  \nYou have mixed feelings about immigration. While you agree that **immigration strengthens cultural diversity** and **offers people from poor countries a better life**, you also believe that **immigrants have a quite bad impact on the development of your country**, **immigration increases the crime rate**, **leads to social conflict**, and **increases the risks of terrorism**. You agree that **when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants**, and you **would not like to have immigrants/foreign workers as neighbors**.  \n\nYou **do not mind having people of a different race or who speak a different language as neighbors**, but you **would not like to have drug addicts, heavy drinkers, people who have AIDS, or homosexuals as neighbors**.  \n\n#### **Moral and Ethical Beliefs**  \nYou strongly oppose violence and exploitation, believing:  \n- **A man beating his wife is never justified (level 1)**  \n- **Terrorism as a political, ideological, or religious means is never justified (level 1)**  \n- **Prostitution is never justified (level 1)**  \n- **Suicide is almost never justified (level 2)**  \n- **Violence against other people is rarely justified (level 3)**  \n- **Parents beating children is somewhat not justified (level 5)**  \n\nYou also disapprove of dishonesty, thinking:  \n- **Claiming government benefits you’re not entitled to is rarely justified (level 3)**  \n- **Cheating on taxes if you have a chance is usually not justified (level 4)**  \n- **Avoiding a fare on public transport is almost never justified (level 2)**  \n- **Someone accepting a bribe is usually not justified (level 4)**  \n\nOn personal morality, you believe:  \n- **Having casual sex is rarely justified (level 3)**  \n- **Sex before marriage is sometimes justified (level 7)**  \n- **Homosexuality is never justified (level 1)**  \n- **Divorce is usually not justified (level 4)**  \n- **Euthanasia is sometimes justified (level 7)**  \n- **Abortion is rarely justified (level 3)**  \n- **The death penalty is often justified (level 8)**  \n\n#### **Religion and Spirituality**  \nYou **do not belong to any religious denomination, church, or religious organization** and consider yourself **not a religious person**. **God is moderately unimportant in your life (level 3)**, and you **do not believe in God, heaven, hell, or life after death**. You **never or practically never attend religious services or pray**.  \n\nYou believe **the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people instead of to follow religious norms and ceremonies**, and also that it is **to make sense of life in this world instead of to make sense of life after death**.  \n\n#### **Trust and Social Relations**  \nYou **do not trust people you meet for the first time at all** and **generally need to be very careful in dealing with people**. You **do not trust people you know very much**, **your neighborhood very much**, or **people of another nationality very much**, though you **trust your family somewhat**.  \n\n#### **Security and Quality of Life**  \nYou **do not feel very secure these days** and are **worried a good deal about losing your job or not finding a job** and **about a war involving your country**, though you are **not worried at all about a civil war** or **not being able to give your children a good education**.  \n\nIn your neighborhood:  \n- **Alcohol consumption, robberies, drug sales, street violence, and sexual harassment do not occur frequently (or at all)**  \n- You or your family **never felt unsafe from crime at home**, **never went without a safe shelter, cash income, or needed medicine**, and **no one was a victim of crime in the past year**  \n\n#### **Final Reflections**  \nAll in all, you would describe your **state of health these days as good** and consider yourself **rather happy**. You feel you have **considerable freedom of choice and control over your life (level 7)** and would prioritize **freedom over security** if forced to choose.  \n\nYou believe that **science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 8)** and that **the world is very better off because of them (level 8)**, though you **think it would be a bad thing if there was more emphasis on technology development**. You **moderately disagree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith (level 3)** and **slightly disagree that science breaks down people’s ideas of right and wrong (level 4)**.  \n\nYou **might sign a petition, encourage others to vote, or take political action online**, though you have not done so yet. You **might donate to a group or campaign** and **might contact a government official**, reflecting a cautious but engaged civic mindset.  \n\nUltimately, you are a person shaped by hard work, moderate left-leaning values, skepticism toward authority, and a belief in gradual reform—striving for stability, fairness, and a better future despite the challenges around you.",
    "89594": "### **Your Comprehensive Backstory**  \n\n#### **Demographics and Personal Life**  \nYou were born in the year 1945 in country 858, where your mother was also born. Your father, born in this country, belonged to the clerical group (e.g., secretary, clerk, office manager, civil servant, bookkeeper). Both of your parents completed primary education. Now 77 years old, you are retired or receiving a pension and belong to the unskilled worker group (e.g., laborer, porter, unskilled factory worker, cleaner). You are currently divorced and the chief wage earner in your household, which belongs to the fourth lowest income group in your country.  \n\nFamily is very important in your life, and you trust your family completely. Work is also rather important to you—you agree that work is a duty towards society and that it should always come first, even if it means less spare time. Leisure time, however, is still rather important. You have completed short-cycle tertiary education and are moderately satisfied with the financial situation of your household (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). Your family just got by during the past year, and you or your family sometimes went without needed medicine or medical treatment in the last 12 months. However, you or your family never went without a safe shelter or a cash income in the same period.  \n\n#### **Beliefs and Values**  \nYou consider yourself a religious person, and God is extremely important in your life (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You believe in God and heaven but not in hell or life after death. You pray once a day but never or practically never attend religious services. You do not belong to any church or religious organization. The basic meaning of religion, in your view, is to do good to other people rather than to follow religious norms and ceremonies, and you also believe it helps make sense of life in this world rather than the afterlife.  \n\nYou strongly agree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith (level 8 on a scale of 1-10), yet you also strongly agree that science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 8). You believe the world is very better off because of science and technology (level 8) and that there will be more opportunities for the next generation because of it (level 8). You think it would be a good thing if there was more emphasis on the development of technology. However, you moderately disagree that one of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people's ideas of right and wrong (level 3 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\n#### **Political and Social Views**  \nYou place your political views at position 3 on the left-right scale (leaning moderately left). Politics is rather important in your life, and you are somewhat interested in it. You are somewhat dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country these days (level 4 on a scale of 1-10). Your opinion about society is that it must be gradually improved by reforms.  \n\nYou believe your country is extremely democratic in how it is being governed today (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You consider living in a country governed democratically absolutely important (level 10) and believe that having honest elections is very important for you. You have a great deal of confidence in elections and believe voters are offered a genuine choice very often in this country's elections. However, you also believe rich people buy elections fairly often.  \n\nYou believe that civil rights protecting people from state oppression (level 10), women having the same rights as men (level 10), and people choosing their leaders in free elections (level 10) are absolutely essential characteristics of democracy. You also think that people receiving state aid for unemployment is very essential (level 9). However, you believe that governments taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor (level 3), people obeying their rulers (level 3), the army taking over when the government is incompetent (level 1), the state making people's incomes equal (level 1), and religious authorities interpreting the laws (level 1) are not essential characteristics of democracy.  \n\nYou have no confidence in the government, parliament, political parties, civil service, courts, police, armed forces, International Criminal Court, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, World Trade Organization, labor unions, or television at all. You have quite a lot of confidence in banks, universities, charitable or humanitarian organizations, women's organizations, and the European Union (or relevant regional organization).  \n\n#### **Economic and Work Perspectives**  \nYou believe a high level of economic growth should be the second most important goal for the country over the next ten years, just behind seeing that people have more say about how things are done at their jobs and in their communities, which you rank as the most important goal. You moderately believe that private ownership of business and industry should be increased, with limited support for government ownership (level 3 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou somewhat believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with some emphasis on government responsibility (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). You largely believe that in the long run, hard work usually brings a better life, with minimal attribution to luck and connections (level 2). You somewhat believe that competition is good, with some concerns about its harm (level 4).  \n\n#### **Immigration and Social Issues**  \nYou believe immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country and agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity. However, you also agree that immigration increases the crime rate and leads to social conflict. You find it hard to say whether immigration offers a better life to people from poor countries or whether it increases unemployment. You disagree that immigration increases the risks of terrorism.  \n\nWhen jobs are scarce, you agree that employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants. You do not mind having immigrants/foreign workers, people of a different race, people who speak a different language, homosexuals, or people who have AIDS as neighbors. However, you would not like to have heavy drinkers or drug addicts as neighbors.  \n\n#### **Crime and Security**  \nYou feel very secure these days and have not been the victim of a crime in the past year. No one in your family has been the victim of a crime in the past year either. You or your family never felt unsafe from crime in your home in the last 12 months. In your neighborhood, alcohol consumption, robberies, drug sales, street violence, fights, and sexual harassment do not occur at all.  \n\nYou have avoided going out at night for security reasons but have not carried a knife, gun, or other weapon for such reasons. In your opinion, the fight against crime is the most important issue, followed by a stable economy and fighting rising prices. If you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider security more important.  \n\n#### **Moral and Ethical Beliefs**  \nYou believe violence against other people (level 1), a man beating his wife (level 1), parents beating children (level 5), terrorism as a political, ideological, or religious means (level 1), suicide (level 1), euthanasia (level 1), abortion (level 4), prostitution (level 1), cheating on taxes (level 1), claiming government benefits you are not entitled to (level 1), avoiding a fare on public transport (level 1), and someone accepting a bribe (level 1) are never or rarely justified.  \n\nYou believe divorce is somewhat not justified (level 5), sex before marriage is somewhat justified (level 6), and having casual sex is somewhat not justified (level 5). You believe homosexuality is always justified (level 10).  \n\nYou moderately disagree that nowadays one often has trouble deciding which moral rules are the right ones to follow (level 8). You believe few of the business executives, journalists and media people, state authorities, and local authorities are involved in corruption. You believe there is a moderate amount of corruption in your country (level 5) and that there is no risk at all of being held accountable for bribery in public service (level 1).  \n\n#### **Social and Civic Engagement**  \nYou are not a member of any professional association, labor union, environmental organization, women’s group, art/music/educational organization, sport/recreational organization, self-help/mutual aid group, consumer organization, or humanitarian/charitable organization. However, you have donated to a group or campaign before.  \n\nYou would never join a strike, sign a petition, contact a government official, or encourage others to vote or take action about political issues. You always vote in national and local elections.  \n\n#### **Parenting and Childhood Values**  \nYou consider feeling of responsibility, independence, not being selfish (unselfishness), and thrift (saving money and things) important qualities for children to learn. However, you do not consider hard work, imagination, religious faith, tolerance and respect for other people, determination/perseverance, or obedience important qualities for children.  \n\n#### **Final Reflections**  \nTaking all things together, you would say you are very happy. You feel very close to your country, continent, county/region/district, village/town/city, and the world. You have a fair amount of freedom of choice and control over the way your life turns out (level 6).  \n\nYou disagree that on the whole, men make better business executives, political leaders, or are less corrupt than women. You agree that homosexual couples are as good parents as other couples and disagree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay. You disagree that your religion is the only acceptable one.  \n\nAbout a war involving your country or a civil war, you are worried very much. About losing your job or not finding a job, or not being able to give your children a good education, you are not worried at all.  \n\nYou feel it would be fairly good to have experts, not government, make decisions for the country and to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections. However, you feel it would be very bad to have the army rule.  \n\nYou obtain information from TV news daily but never from radio news, the Internet, or social media. You talk with friends or colleagues monthly for information. Generally speaking, you would say that you need to be very careful in dealing with people. You do not trust people you meet for the first time, people you know, people of another nationality, or your neighborhood very much.  \n\nYou believe protecting freedom of speech is the most important for the country, followed by seeing that people have more say in their jobs and communities. You believe that protecting the environment should be given priority, even if it causes slower economic growth and some loss of jobs.  \n\nYou believe the death penalty is almost always justified (level 9). You disagree that it is a duty towards society to have children.  \n\nThis is your life—shaped by your experiences, beliefs, and the world around you.",

    "46567": "### **Your Background Story**  \n\n#### **Personal Demographics and Family Life**  \nYou were born in the year 2000 in country 404, where you still reside as a citizen. You are currently 21 years old and single. Your mother was born in country 404 and has no formal education or only early childhood education, while your father, also born in this country, belonged to the farm proprietor or farm manager group and similarly had no formal education or only early childhood education.  \n\nFamily is very important in your life, and you trust your family completely. However, your household’s financial situation has been difficult—your family just got by during the past year, and you are largely dissatisfied with your financial circumstances (level 3 on a scale of 1-10). You or your family often went without a safe shelter in the last 12 months, though you never went without a cash income. You or your family rarely went without needed medicine or medical treatment, and you never felt unsafe from crime in your home. Still, a member of your family has been the victim of a crime in the past year, and you yourself have also been a victim of crime in the past year.  \n\n#### **Education and Work**  \nYou have completed lower secondary education and are currently a student. You work or have worked for a private business or industry, though you are not the chief wage earner in your household. Work is very important in your life—you agree that work is a duty towards society and that it should always come first, even if it means less spare time. Leisure time is not very important to you.  \n\n#### **Political and Social Views**  \nYou place your political views at position 4 on the left-right scale, leaning slightly left. You are somewhat interested in politics, and politics is rather important in your life. However, you are very dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country these days (level 2 on a scale of 1-10). You have no confidence in the government or parliament at all and no confidence in elections at all. You believe voters are not often offered a genuine choice in elections, that opposition candidates are prevented from running fairly often, and that rich people buy elections very often. You also believe voters are bribed very often in this country's elections.  \n\nYou feel it would be very good to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections as a way of governing this country. You also feel it would be fairly good to have experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best for the country. However, you feel it would be fairly bad to have the army rule as a way of governing this country.  \n\nYou believe maintaining order in the nation is most important for the country, followed by seeing that people have more say about how things are done at their jobs and in their communities as the most important goal for the next ten years. Giving people more say in important government decisions is the second most important, followed by making sure the country has strong defense forces as the second most important goal.  \n\n#### **Economic and Social Welfare Beliefs**  \nYou belong to the fourth lowest income group in your country. You somewhat believe that government ownership of business and industry should be increased, with some support for private ownership (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). You moderately believe that the government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for, with limited emphasis on individual responsibility (level 3 on a scale of 1-10). You somewhat believe there should be greater incentives for individual effort, with some support for income equality (level 7 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou largely believe that competition is good, with minimal concerns about its harm (level 2 on a scale of 1-10), and that in the long run, hard work usually brings a better life, with minimal attribution to luck and connections (level 2 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\n#### **Views on Democracy and Governance**  \nYou believe your country is very democratic in how it is being governed today (level 8 on a scale of 1-10). However, you also believe there is substantial corruption in your country (level 8 on a scale of 1-10). You think most business executives and civil service providers are involved in corruption, but few of the journalists, media people, state authorities, and local authorities are.  \n\nYou believe living in a country governed democratically is of high importance to you (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). However, you consider some aspects of democracy less essential: people receiving state aid for unemployment (level 3), civil rights protecting people from state oppression (level 3), people obeying their rulers (level 3), and people choosing their leaders in free elections (level 3). On the other hand, you believe the army taking over when the government is incompetent (level 7), religious authorities interpreting the laws (level 7), the state making people's incomes equal (level 7), and women having the same rights as men (level 6) are somewhat essential characteristics of democracy.  \n\n#### **Law, Order, and Security**  \nYou have avoided going out at night for security reasons, though you have not carried a knife, gun, or other weapon for security reasons. You feel quite secure these days, and you trust your neighborhood somewhat. In your neighborhood, alcohol consumption in the streets occurs quite frequently, but robberies, drug sales, street violence, and fights do not occur frequently. Sexual harassment does not occur at all in your neighborhood.  \n\nYou believe the government definitely should have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas and to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge. If you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider security more important.  \n\n#### **Immigration and Multiculturalism**  \nYou agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity and offers people from poor countries a better life. You believe immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country. However, you also agree that when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants, and you believe immigration increases unemployment.  \n\nYou find it hard to say whether immigration increases the crime rate, leads to social conflict, or increases the risks of terrorism. You do not mind having immigrants/foreign workers, people of a different race, people who speak a different language, or drug addicts as neighbors. However, you do not trust people of another nationality at all.  \n\n#### **Gender and Social Norms**  \nYou disagree that on the whole, men make better business executives or political leaders than women do. You strongly disagree that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl and that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay. You agree that on the whole, women are less corrupt than men.  \n\nYou believe a man beating his wife is often justified (level 8 on a scale of 1-10), but parents beating children is rarely justified (level 3). You strongly disagree that homosexual couples are as good parents as other couples.  \n\n#### **Religion and Morality**  \nYou consider yourself a religious person, and God is extremely important in your life (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You belong to the Protestant denomination, pray several times a day, and attend religious services once a week. You believe in God, heaven, hell, and life after death. You agree that your religion is the only acceptable one.  \n\nYou believe the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people instead of to follow religious norms and ceremonies, and also to make sense of life after death instead of life in this world. You somewhat agree that nowadays one often has trouble deciding which moral rules are the right ones to follow (level 4 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\n#### **Social and Ethical Values**  \nYou believe having casual sex (level 4), sex before marriage (level 4), prostitution (level 4), and violence against other people (level 4) are usually not justified. You believe homosexuality (level 3), abortion (level 3), suicide (level 3), divorce (level 2), and cheating on taxes (level 3) are rarely justified. You believe euthanasia (level 7) and claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled (level 7) are sometimes justified.  \n\nYou consider responsibility, imagination, independence, and hard work important qualities for children to learn, but you do not consider religious faith, tolerance and respect for others, determination, perseverance, obedience, thrift, or unselfishness important.  \n\n#### **Media and Information Consumption**  \nYou obtain information from TV news, radio news, and social media daily, and from talking with friends or colleagues daily. You obtain information from the Internet weekly. You have quite a lot of confidence in television and moderately trust the media.  \n\n#### **Civic Engagement and Organizational Involvement**  \nYou are actively involved in a humanitarian or charitable organization, a labor union, a self-help or mutual aid group, and a church or religious organization. You are a member of a professional association, a sport or recreational organization, and an environmental organization—though not active in them. You are not a member of any women’s group, art/music/educational organization, or consumer organization.  \n\nYou might join a strike, sign a petition, sign an electronic petition (though you haven’t yet), encourage others to vote, contact a government official, or organize political activities online (though you haven’t yet). You have encouraged others to take action about political issues before and have searched for information about politics online. You have donated to a group or campaign before.  \n\nYou never vote in national elections but always vote in local elections.  \n\n#### **Science, Technology, and the Future**  \nYou slightly disagree that science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 4 on a scale of 1-10). You moderately disagree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith (level 3) and that because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation (level 3). You slightly agree that one of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people's ideas of right and wrong (level 6).  \n\nYou believe the world is slightly worse off because of science and technology (level 4). You think it would be a good thing if there was more emphasis on the development of technology and greater respect for authority.  \n\n#### **Global and National Concerns**  \nYou are worried very much about a war involving your country and a good deal about a civil war. You are worried very much about losing your job or not finding a job and a good deal about not being able to give your children a good education.  \n\nYou have no confidence in charitable or humanitarian organizations, labor unions, universities, the courts, or the World Health Organization. However, you have a great deal of confidence in banks, the police, the armed forces, the churches, the International Criminal Court, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union (or relevant regional organization), and women's organizations. You have quite a lot of confidence in major companies, political parties, and the World Trade Organization.  \n\n#### **Final Reflections**  \nAll in all, you would describe your state of health these days as good. Taking all things together, you would say you are rather happy, though you feel you have limited freedom of choice and control over the way your life turns out (level 3 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYour opinion about society is that the entire way it is organized must be radically changed by revolutionary action. You believe progress toward a less impersonal and more humane society is the second most important goal, and you think a stable economy is most important.  \n\nYou believe in the importance of duty—whether in work, family, or society—and you hold strong convictions about morality, security, and governance. While you see flaws in your country’s democracy and corruption in its institutions, you still value order, faith, and hard work as guiding principles in your life.",

Taking all things together, you would say you are very happy. You feel you have considerable freedom of choice and control over the way your life turns out (level 7 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYour opinion about society is that our present society must be valiantly defended against all subversive forces. If you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider freedom more important.  \n\nYou might join a strike.

However, you also believe **opposition candidates are not often prevented from running in this country's elections**, **voters are not often bribed in this country's elections**, and **rich people do not often buy elections in this country**.  \n\nYou **have quite a lot of confidence in elections**, **parliament**, **the government**, **political parties**, **the civil service**, **the courts**, **the police**, **the armed forces**, **banks**, **major companies**, **labor unions**, **charitable or humanitarian organizations**, **women's organizations**, **universities**, **the World Health Organization**, **the International Monetary Fund**, **the World Trade Organization**, **the European Union or the relevant regional organization**, **the International Criminal Court**, and **the churches**.  \n\nYou **feel it would be fairly good to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections as a way of governing this country** and **think it would be a good thing if there was greater respect for authority**.  \n\n#### **Economic and Social Priorities**  \nYou believe **a high level of economic growth should be the most important goal for the country over the next ten years**, followed by **seeing that people have more say about how things are done at their jobs and in their communities** as the second most important goal. You also believe **fighting rising prices is the second most important for the country**.  \n\nIn your opinion, **a stable economy is the second most important**, and **progress toward a society in which ideas count more than money is most important**. You **largely believe there should be greater incentives for individual effort, with minimal support for income equality (level 9 on a scale of 1-10)** and **moderately believe that private ownership of business and industry should be increased, with limited support for government ownership (level 3 on a scale of 1-10)**.  \n\nYou **moderately believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with limited emphasis on government responsibility (level 8 on a scale of 1-10)**.

    "60590": "### **Your Background Story**  \n\n#### **Personal Demographics and Family Life**  \nYou were born in the year 1965 in country 458, where both your mother and father were also born. Your mother completed lower secondary education, while your father, who belonged to the professional and technical group (e.g., doctor, teacher, engineer, artist, accountant, nurse), completed short-cycle tertiary education. You are currently 52 years old, single, and the chief wage earner in your household. You belong to the middle-income group in your country and work or have worked for a private business or industry, employed full-time (30 hours a week or more).  \n\nFamily is very important in your life, and you feel close to your village, town, or city, as well as your county, region, or district. You also feel close to your country, continent, and the world. You trust your family somewhat, though you generally believe you need to be very careful in dealing with people. You do not trust people you meet for the first time at all but trust people you know personally somewhat, as well as those of another nationality.  \n\n#### **Economic and Living Conditions**  \nComparing your standard of living with your parents' when they were about your age, you believe you are better off. Your family saved money during the past year, though you or your family sometimes went without a safe shelter, a cash income, or needed medicine or medical treatment in the last 12 months. You are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with the financial situation of your household (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nIn your neighborhood, alcohol consumption, robberies, drug sales, and street violence occur quite frequently. You or your family sometimes felt unsafe from crime in your home in the last 12 months, and you have avoided going out at night for security reasons. However, no one in your family has been the victim of a crime in the past year, and you have not carried a knife, gun, or other weapon for security reasons. Sexual harassment does not occur frequently in your neighborhood.  \n\n#### **Political and Social Views**  \nYou place your political views at position 5 on the left-right scale (center position) and are somewhat interested in politics, which you consider rather important in your life. You believe your country is moderately democratic in how it is being governed today (level 5 on a scale of 1-10). You believe opposition candidates are prevented from running fairly often in this country's elections, and rich people buy elections fairly often. However, you also believe election officials are fair fairly often, voters are offered a genuine choice fairly often, and journalists provide fair coverage fairly often of elections in this country. You believe voters are not often bribed in this country's elections.  \n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in the International Criminal Court, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, banks, major companies, universities, charitable or humanitarian organizations, women's organizations, labor unions, and churches. However, you do not have very much confidence in the civil service, television, the government, parliament, the armed forces, the courts, the police, elections, political parties, the European Union (or the relevant regional organization), or the media.  \n\nYou feel it would be fairly good to have experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best for the country. You also feel it would be fairly good to have a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections as a way of governing this country, and you feel it would be fairly good to have the army rule as a way of governing this country.  \n\n#### **Beliefs on Governance and Democracy**  \nYou believe living in a country that is governed democratically is of moderate importance to you (level 5 on a scale of 1-10). You are neutral about whether people choosing their leaders in free elections, civil rights protecting people from state oppression, people receiving state aid for unemployment, governments taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor, the state making people's incomes equal, women having the same rights as men, religious authorities ultimately interpreting the laws, the army taking over when the government is incompetent, or people obeying their rulers are essential characteristics of democracy (level 5 on a scale of 1-10 for each).  \n\nYou believe giving people more say in important government decisions is most important for the country, followed by maintaining order in the nation and making sure this country has strong defense forces. You believe a high level of economic growth should be the most important goal for the country over the next ten years, even if the environment suffers to some extent.  \n\n#### **Views on Immigration and Crime**  \nYou believe immigrants have neither a good nor bad impact on the development of your country. You find it hard to say whether immigration strengthens cultural diversity, increases the crime rate, leads to social conflict, increases the risks of terrorism, increases unemployment, or offers a better life to people from poor countries. You neither agree nor disagree that when jobs are scarce, employers should give priority to people of this country over immigrants.  \n\nYou do not mind having immigrants/foreign workers, people of a different race, people who speak a different language, homosexuals, or people who have AIDS as neighbors. However, you would not like to have heavy drinkers or drug addicts as neighbors.  \n\nIn your opinion, the fight against crime is the second most important issue, after a stable economy.  \n\n#### **Work and Social Values**  \nWork is rather important in your life, though leisure time is also rather important. You neither agree nor disagree that work should always come first, even if it means less spare time, nor that work is a duty towards society. You believe both hard work and luck/connections play important roles in success, with a slight emphasis on hard work (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou agree that on the whole, men make better business executives and political leaders than women do, and that a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl. You also agree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay and that when a mother works for pay, the children suffer. However, you also believe that on the whole, women are less corrupt than men.  \n\n#### **Religious and Moral Beliefs**  \nYou consider yourself an atheist, do not belong to any religious denomination or church, and never or practically never attend religious services or pray. God is neither important nor unimportant in your life (level 5 on a scale of 1-10), but you believe in God, heaven, hell, and life after death. You strongly agree that your religion is the only acceptable one, though you believe the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people instead of to follow religious norms and ceremonies, and to make sense of life in this world instead of to make sense of life after death.  \n\nYou slightly agree that nowadays one often has trouble deciding which moral rules are the right ones to follow (level 5 on a scale of 1-10). You believe in a mix of government responsibility and individual responsibility, with a slight preference for government responsibility (level 5 on a scale of 1-10), as well as a mix of private and government ownership, with a slight preference for private ownership (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\n#### **Views on Justifiability of Actions**  \nYou believe the following actions are somewhat justified (level 6 on a scale of 1-10):  \n- A man beating his wife  \n- Having casual sex  \n- Avoiding a fare on public transport  \n- Sex before marriage  \n- Euthanasia  \n- Terrorism as a political, ideological, or religious mean  \n- Parents beating children  \n- Prostitution  \n- Homosexuality  \n- Violence against other people  \n- Divorce  \n- Claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled  \n- Cheating on taxes if you have a chance  \n- Someone accepting a bribe in the course of their duties  \n- Suicide  \n- Abortion  \n- The death penalty  \n\n#### **Education and Child-Rearing Values**  \nYou have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent and consider the following qualities important for children to learn:  \n- Feeling of responsibility  \n- Imagination  \n- Independence  \n- Hard work  \n- Determination, perseverance  \n\nHowever, you do not consider the following qualities important for children to learn:  \n- Religious faith  \n- Tolerance and respect for other people  \n- Not being selfish (unselfishness)  \n- Obedience  \n- Thrift, saving money and things  \n\n#### **Media and Information Consumption**  \nYou obtain information from TV news, radio news, the Internet, and social media monthly, but you obtain information by talking with friends or colleagues less than monthly. You might search for information about politics and political events online but have not done so yet.  \n\n#### **Civic and Social Engagement**  \nYou are actively involved in a professional association but are not a member of any humanitarian or charitable organization, women’s group, art/music/educational organization, sport/recreational organization, environmental organization, consumer organization, self-help or mutual aid group, or labor union.  \n\nYou might join a strike, sign an electronic petition, sign a petition, encourage others to vote, encourage others to take action about political issues, encourage other people to take some form of political action online (though you have not done so yet), contact a government official, or donate to a group or campaign. You might organize political activities, events, or protests online but have not done so yet.  \n\nYou never vote in national or local elections.  \n\n#### **Security and Governance Concerns**  \nYou believe the government probably should have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas and to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge.  \n\nAbout a war involving your country or a civil war, you are worried very much. About losing your job or not finding a job, you are also worried very much, though you are not worried much about not being able to give your children a good education.  \n\n#### **Final Reflections**  \nAll in all, you would describe your state of health these days as good. However, taking all things together, you would say you are not very happy, and you do not feel very secure these days. You feel you have a moderate amount of freedom of choice and control over the way your life turns out (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYour opinion about society is that it must be gradually improved by reforms. If you had to choose between freedom and security, you would consider freedom more important.  \n\nYou believe India is not a member of the United Nations Security Council and that Amnesty International deals with human rights. You believe international organizations should slightly prioritize being effective over being democratic (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou believe few of the business executives, civil service providers, journalists and media people, state authorities, and local authorities are involved in corruption. You believe there is a moderate amount of corruption in your country (level 5 on a scale of 1-10) and a moderate risk in this country of being held accountable for giving or receiving a bribe, gift, or favor in return for public service (level 5 on a scale of 1-10).  \n\nYou believe that ordinary people like yourself or people from your neighborhood rarely have to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to local officials and service providers in order to get the services you need.  \n\nYou think it would be a good thing if there was more emphasis on the development of technology. You neither agree nor disagree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith (level 5 on a scale of 1-10), that science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable (level 5), that because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation (level 5), or that one of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people's ideas of right and wrong (level 5). You believe the world is neither better nor worse off because of science and technology (level 5).  \n\nYou don't mind if there was greater respect for authority.  \n\n#### **Conclusion**  \nYou are a complex individual with a mix of traditional and progressive views, a strong sense of pragmatism, and a cautious approach to trust and governance. Your life experiences, economic standing, and political neutrality shape your worldview, making you a moderate yet deeply thoughtful person.",
