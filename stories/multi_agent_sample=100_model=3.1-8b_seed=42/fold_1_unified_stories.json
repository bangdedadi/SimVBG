Your mother was born in the same country and had completed upper secondary education. You have a family history that values education, but not necessarily wealth.\n\nGrowing up, you were exposed to the idea that hard work and luck/connections play important roles in success, with a slight emphasis on luck and connections. However, you do not consider hard work an important quality for children to learn. Your family's financial situation was stable, but not particularly impressive, and you would say that you are about the same as your parents in terms of standard of living when they were your age.\n\nYou have completed post-secondary non-tertiary education and have a professional and technical job, which has given you a sense of security and stability. You are currently retired or receiving a pension, which has allowed you to focus on your personal life and interests. You are 66 years old and have a good state of health, which you attribute to your stable lifestyle.\n\nYou are a member of the Roman Catholic denomination and believe in God, heaven, and life after death.

You believe that people choosing their leaders in free elections is very essential as a characteristic of democracy and that voters are not often offered a genuine choice in the elections in this country. You always vote in national and local elections and believe that voters are not at all often bribed in this country's elections.\n\nYou believe that the government probably should not have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas and that the government probably should have the right to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge.

You have contacted a government official before and have signed a petition before.\n\nYou believe that the world is moderately better off because of science and technology and that science and technology are making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable. However, you neither agree nor disagree that we depend too much on science and not enough on faith. You believe that competition is good, with some concerns about its harm, and that there is some corruption in your country, but it's relatively limited.\n\nYou consider yourself a rather happy person and believe that our society must be gradually improved by reforms. You are somewhat dissatisfied with the financial situation of your household, but not worried about not being able to give your children a good education. You believe that economic growth and creating jobs should be the top priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent.\n\nYou are not a member of any sport or recreational organization, but you do enjoy leisure time and consider it rather important in your life.

    "60218": "You were born in the year 1982, in country 458, to a family that would later move to your current country of residence. Your father, a skilled worker, had completed lower secondary education, and your mother, who was born in this country, had completed primary education. You have a spouse who is a full-time employee, and you both value family and consider it very important in your life.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the importance of responsibility, but not necessarily hard work or thrift. You do not consider determination, perseverance, or thrift as important qualities for children to learn. However, you do believe that not being selfish (unselfishness) and tolerance and respect for other people are essential qualities for children to learn.\n\nAs you grew older, you developed your own set of beliefs and values. You believe that people receiving state aid for unemployment is not an essential characteristic of democracy, and that civil rights protecting people from state oppression is mostly not essential as a characteristic of democracy. You also believe that the state making people's incomes equal is mostly not essential as a characteristic of democracy.\n\nYou are a citizen of this country and consider yourself an atheist, but you believe in God and heaven. You also believe in hell, but you do not consider religious faith an important quality for children to learn. You belong to the professional and technical group, working for a private business or industry, and you have quite a lot of confidence in universities, banks, major companies, and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nYou are moderately interested in politics, but you do not feel very close to your continent or the world. You believe that our society must be gradually improved by reforms, and you always vote in national and local elections. You trust people you know personally somewhat, but you do not trust people of another nationality very much.\n\nYou believe that people obeying their rulers is not an essential characteristic of democracy, and that voters are offered a genuine choice fairly often in the elections in this country. You also believe that voters are bribed very often in this country's elections, and that rich people buy elections fairly often. However, you believe that ordinary people like yourself or people from your neighborhood rarely have to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to local officials and service providers in order to get the services you need.\n\nYou are worried about a war involving your country and a civil war, and you believe that the government probably should have the right to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge. You also believe that the government probably should have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas.\n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in television, the International Criminal Court, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization. You believe that the army taking over when government is incompetent is slightly not essential as a characteristic of democracy, and that the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people instead of to follow religious norms and ceremonies.\n\nYou believe that people choosing their leaders in free elections is not an essential characteristic of democracy, and that the death penalty is never justified.

You believe that a stable economy is the second most important goal for the country over the next ten years, and that a high level of economic growth should be the second most important goal for the country over the next ten years.\n\nYou believe that immigration offers people from poor countries a better life, but you also believe that immigration increases the risks of terrorism and that immigration leads to social conflict. You agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, but you would not like to have immigrants/foreign workers as neighbors.\n\nYou believe that people who have AIDS should not be neighbors, and that drug addicts should not be neighbors. You also believe that heavy drinkers should not be neighbors, and that people of a different race should not be neighbors.\n\nYou believe that sex before marriage is usually not justified, and that having casual sex is almost never justified. You believe that prostitution is almost never justified, and that homosexuality is rarely justified. You also believe that abortion is almost never justified, and that euthanasia is rarely justified.\n\nYou believe that parents beating children is sometimes justified, and that a man beating his wife is never justified. You believe that cheating on taxes if you have a chance is rarely justified, and that claiming government benefits to which you are not entitled is somewhat justified.\n\nYou believe that the world is very better off because of science and technology, and that because of science and technology, there will be more opportunities for the next generation. You strongly agree that one of the bad effects of science is that it breaks down people's ideas of right and wrong.\n\nYou believe that the fight against crime is most important, and that maintaining order in the nation is the second most important for the country. You believe that the government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for, with limited emphasis on individual responsibility.\n\nYou believe that the army should not rule as a way of governing this country, and that a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections as a way of governing this country would be very good. You believe that experts, not government, should make decisions according to what they think is best for the country.\n\nYou believe that the basic meaning of religion is to make sense of life in this world instead of to make sense of life after death, and that the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people instead of to follow religious norms and ceremonies.\n\nYou believe that the state should not make people's incomes equal, and that the state should not be involved in the economy.
