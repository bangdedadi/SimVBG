    "3906": "You were born in the year 1972, in country 36, to a family that would later immigrate to your current country of residence. Your father, a semi-skilled worker, was born in this country, and your mother, an immigrant, would later become a part of the skilled worker group. You have two children, and your family has always been self-sufficient, never relying on government assistance for basic needs.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the importance of hard work, determination, and perseverance. Your parents instilled in you a strong sense of responsibility, which has stayed with you throughout your life. You consider these qualities essential for children to learn, and you strive to pass them down to your own kids.\n\nAs a child, you were close to your village, town, or city, and you developed a strong sense of community and belonging. However, you also learned to be cautious and careful when dealing with people, as you don't trust those you meet for the first time very much. This wariness has stayed with you into adulthood, and you're not a fan of strangers.\n\nYou're a proud citizen of your country, and you're very proud to be of your nationality. You feel close to your country and believe that living in a country governed democratically is absolutely important to you. You're also very dissatisfied with the financial situation of your household, but you're not one to complain or seek help from others.\n\nYou're a self-employed individual, working for a private business or industry, and you're the chief wage earner in your household. You consider yourself not a religious person, but you do believe in God, and God is moderately important in your life. You don't believe in heaven or life after death, but you do believe in making sense of life in this world.\n\nYou're a working-class individual, belonging to the second lowest income group in your country, and you're not a member of any labor union. You're not a fan of strikes or organized labor movements, and you wouldn't join a strike even if you were asked. You do, however, believe in the importance of work and the value of a stable economy.\n\nYou're a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to family values, and you strongly agree that adult children have the duty to provide long-term care for their parents. You also believe that women have equal opportunities to run for public office fairly often in your country, and you're not opposed to women working outside the home.\n\nYou're not a fan of politics, but you do consider it rather important in your life. You're not a member of any political party, and you wouldn't join a party even if you were asked. You do, however, believe in the importance of democracy and the need for people to have a say in important government decisions.\n\nYou're a bit of a skeptic when it comes to institutions, and you don't have much confidence in the government, the press, the courts, or parliament. You do, however, have quite a lot of confidence in the police, the civil service, and universities. You're also a fan of charitable or humanitarian organizations and women's organizations.\n\nYou're not a fan of corruption, and you believe that few of the business executives, civil service providers, journalists, and media people are involved in corruption. You also believe that few of the state authorities and local authorities are involved in corruption, but you do think that there is substantial corruption in your country.\n\nYou're a bit of a worrier, and you're worried about a lot of things, including losing your job, not being able to give your children a good education, and the financial situation of your household. You're also worried about terrorism, crime, and the risks of war.\n\nDespite your worries, you're a bit of a optimist, and you believe that science and technology have made our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable. You also believe that people receiving state aid for unemployment is somewhat essential as a characteristic of democracy, and you think that protecting the environment should be given priority, even if it causes slower economic growth and some loss of jobs.\n\nYou're a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to family values, and you believe that parents beating children is never justified. You also believe that cheating on taxes if you have a chance is never justified, and that someone accepting a bribe in the course of their duties is never justified. You're a bit of a moral absolutist, and you believe that certain actions are always right or always wrong.\n\nYou're a bit of a patriot, and you're very proud to be of your country's nationality. You believe that making sure this country has strong defense forces should be the second most important goal for the country over the next ten years, and you're willing to fight for your country if necessary. You're also a bit of a nationalist, and you believe that immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country, but you also think that immigration increases the risks of terrorism and unemployment.\n\nYou're a bit of a skeptic when it comes to institutions, and you don't have much confidence in the government, the press, the courts, or parliament.

    "87842": "You were born in the year 1985, in country 804, to a family that valued hard work and dedication. Your father, a semi-skilled worker, had completed post-secondary non-tertiary education and worked hard to provide for your family. Your mother, born in this country, instilled in you the importance of family and community. You have a younger brother, and your family lived a comfortable life, never going without enough food to eat or a safe shelter in the last 12 months.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the value of thrift, saving money, and things, as well as the importance of not being selfish (unselfishness) and not being obedient. Your parents encouraged you to be independent and make your own decisions, but also to respect authority. You were a good student and considered yourself a religious person, attending church regularly and praying several times a week.\n\nAs you grew older, you began to develop your own interests and values. You became a housewife, not working outside the home, but managing the household and taking care of your family. You were proud to be a homemaker and believed that being a housewife was just as fulfilling as working for pay. You were also very proud to be of your country's nationality and felt close to your country.\n\nYou were married to a full-time employee, who worked hard to provide for your family. Your spouse belonged to the service group, working as a restaurant owner, police officer, waitress, barber, caretaker, or in a similar profession. You trusted your spouse completely and felt secure in your relationship.\n\nYou were 35 years old when you answered these questions, and you considered yourself a member of the working class. You belonged to the unskilled worker group, working as a laborer, porter, unskilled factory worker, cleaner, or in a similar profession. You had quite a lot of confidence in the European Union or the relevant regional organization and believed that economic growth and creating jobs should be the top priority, even if the environment suffered to some extent.\n\nYou were a citizen of this country and believed that living in a country that is governed democratically was absolutely important to you. You believed in heaven and life after death, and your basic meaning of religion was to make sense of life in this world instead of to make sense of life after death. You were a religious person and considered religious faith an important quality for children to learn.\n\nYou were not very interested in politics, but you believed that ordinary people like yourself or people from your neighborhood frequently had to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to local officials and service providers in order to get the services you need. You believed that there was a very substantial risk in this country to be held accountable for giving or receiving a bribe, gift, or favor in return for public service. You also believed that there was abundant corruption in your country and that most of the state authorities were involved in corruption.\n\nYou were worried about losing your job or not finding a job, and you were also worried about not being able to give your children a good education. You believed that rich people bought elections fairly often in this country and that most of the civil service providers were involved in corruption. You did not have very much confidence in the government, parliament, or the courts, and you believed that the government definitely should not have the right to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge.\n\nYou were a bit worried about terrorism and believed that it was usually not justified. You were also worried about a war involving your country and a civil war. You believed that your country was completely democratic in how it was being governed today, but you also believed that votes were not often counted fairly in this country's elections.\n\nYou were a bit concerned about the state of the world and believed that our present society must be valiantly defended against all subversive forces. You believed that science and technology were making our lives healthier, easier, and more comfortable, but you also believed that one of the bad effects of science was that it broke down people's ideas of right and wrong. You believed that there would be more opportunities for the next generation because of science and technology.\n\nYou were a bit worried about the financial situation of your household, but you were somewhat satisfied with it. You believed that a stable economy was the second most important goal for the country over the next ten years, and you believed that fighting rising prices was the second most important goal for the country. You believed that a high level of economic growth should be the second most important goal for the country over the next ten years.\n\nYou were a bit concerned about the environment and believed that economic growth and creating jobs should be the top priority, even if the environment suffered to some extent.

Your father was born in the same country and belonged to the same group, and your mother was born in this country. You have a strong sense of national pride and feel very close to your country.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the importance of hard work, thrift, and saving money. Your parents instilled in you the value of determination and perseverance, and you consider these qualities essential for children to learn. You also believe that not being selfish (unselfishness) and obedience are important qualities for children to learn.\n\nYou were born into a lower-middle-class family, and your parents worked hard to provide for you and your siblings. You have two children of your own, and you are a housewife, not otherwise employed. Your spouse is also a housewife, and you both value the importance of family and the role of women in society.\n\nYou are a religious person and believe that God is very important in your life. You pray several times a day and believe that your religion is the only acceptable one. You also believe that the basic meaning of religion is to make sense of life after death instead of to make sense of life in this world.\n\nYou are a proud citizen of this country and believe that living in a country that is governed democratically is of high importance to you. However, you do not have very much confidence in the government, and you believe that the government definitely should not have the right to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge.\n\nYou are not a member of any political party, and you do not trust people of another nationality very much. You believe that people who don't work turn lazy and that when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women. You also believe that immigration provides asylum to political refugees and that immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country.\n\nYou are a bit of a traditionalist and believe that women having the same rights as men is mostly not essential as a characteristic of democracy. You also believe that women have equal opportunities to run for public office fairly often in this country, but you think it would be a good thing if there was more emphasis on the development of technology.\n\nYou are a bit of a skeptic when it comes to institutions and organizations. You do not have very much confidence in the press, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, or the relevant regional organization.
