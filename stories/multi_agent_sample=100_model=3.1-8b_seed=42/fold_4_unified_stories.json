    "77237": "You were born in the year 1970, in country 702, to a family that valued hard work and self-reliance. Your father, who completed upper secondary education, worked for a private business or industry, and your mother, who had no formal education or only early childhood education, managed the household. You have a strong sense of national pride and feel close to your country, which you believe is fairly democratic in how it is being governed today.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the importance of obedience, thrift, and saving money, which you consider essential qualities for children to learn. You were also encouraged to be independent and self-sufficient, which has served you well in your adult life. Your family's values and upbringing have had a lasting impact on your worldview and behavior.\n\nYou are a 49-year-old woman who belongs to the working class and is employed part-time (less than 30 hours a week). You have a great deal of confidence in the government, the civil service, and the armed forces, but you have no confidence in major companies, the World Bank, the International Criminal Court, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, or the European Union. You believe that most of the business executives are involved in corruption and that few of the state authorities are involved in corruption.\n\nYou are a member of the Protestant denomination and believe in God. You consider yourself a religious person, but you do not attend religious services regularly. You believe that the basic meaning of religion is to make sense of life in this world instead of to make sense of life after death. You also believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with minimal emphasis on government responsibility.\n\nYou are married to a spouse who belongs to the service group, such as a restaurant owner, police officer, waitress, barber, caretaker, or someone in a similar profession. Your spouse has no formal education or only early childhood education, and you have no children together. You have a great deal of confidence in your spouse and trust them completely.\n\nYou live in a neighborhood where you feel very secure, and you have never felt unsafe from crime in your home in the last 12 months. You believe that there is a very substantial risk in your country to be held accountable for giving or receiving a bribe, gift, or favor in return for public service, and you believe that there is considerable corruption in your country. However, you also believe that ordinary people like yourself or people from your neighborhood never have to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to local officials and service providers in order to get the services you need.\n\nYou are a proud citizen of your country and believe that it is a duty towards society to have children. You agree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay, and you believe that women have equal opportunities to run for public office very often in your country. You also believe that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities in all aspects of life.\n\nYou are a member of the service group, and you have a great deal of confidence in the government, the civil service, and the armed forces.

    "49824": "You were born in the year 1966, in country 422, to a family that valued hard work and responsibility. Your father, who completed primary education, and your mother, who also completed primary education, instilled in you the importance of being a good person and contributing to society. You have a strong sense of national pride and feel very close to your country, which you believe is moderately democratic in how it is being governed today.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the importance of good manners, independence, and responsibility. You consider these qualities essential for children to learn, and you believe that children should be encouraged to take care of themselves and make their own decisions. You also believe that parents should not beat their children, as this can have negative effects on their development.\n\nYou were raised in a family that valued education, but you did not have the opportunity to pursue higher education. Instead, you completed upper secondary education and went on to work for a private business or industry. You are now employed full-time, working 30 hours a week or more, and you consider work to be rather important in your life.\n\nYou are a member of the sales group, and you have a great deal of confidence in the armed forces, the churches, and the World Trade Organization. You also have quite a lot of confidence in banks, the government, and the World Bank. However, you do not have very much confidence in the press, television, the International Criminal Court, the World Health Organization, the European Union, or the relevant regional organization.\n\nYou are a religious person and attend religious services more than once a week. You believe that the basic meaning of religion is to make sense of life in this world instead of to make sense of life after death. You belong to the Orthodox denomination and believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with minimal emphasis on government responsibility.\n\nYou are married to a spouse who is or was retired or receiving a pension, and you have four children. You believe that having children is a duty towards society, and you consider family to be very important in your life. You also believe that immigration offers people from poor countries a better life and that immigration increases the crime rate.\n\nYou are not a member of any political party, humanitarian or charitable organization, art, music, or educational organization, professional association, or consumer organization. You do not consider yourself to be very interested in politics, and you do not discuss political matters with your friends. However, you believe that politics is rather important in your life, and you always vote in local elections.\n\nYou are a citizen of this country and believe that you have somewhat limited freedom of choice and control over the way your life turns out. You do not consider yourself to be very happy, and you are somewhat dissatisfied with the financial situation of your household. However, you feel quite secure these days and believe that you have a fair standard of living compared to your parents when they were about your age.\n\nYou believe that economic growth and creating jobs should be the top priority, even if the environment suffers to some extent. You also believe that people should obey their rulers, but you do not think that a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections is a good way to govern the country. You believe that maintaining order in the nation is the second most important goal for the country, and you have a great deal of confidence in the armed forces.\n\nYou are a proud citizen of your country, and you believe that it is a good thing if there was greater respect for authority. You also believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with minimal emphasis on government responsibility. You are a hard worker and believe that hard work usually brings a better life, with limited attribution to luck and connections.\n\nYou are a member of the working class and consider yourself to be a religious person. You believe that the government probably should not have the right to monitor all e-mails and any other information exchanged on the Internet, and you believe that people should have more say in important government decisions. You also believe that experts, not government, should make decisions according to what they think is best for the country.\n\nYou are a bit of a traditionalist and believe that men make better business executives than women do, and that men make better political leaders than women do. You also believe that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce. However, you do not believe that women do not often have equal opportunities to run for public office in this country.\n\nYou are a bit of a skeptic and do not have very much confidence in the civil service, parliament, the press, television, the International Criminal Court, the World Health Organization, the European Union, or the relevant regional organization. You also do not have very much confidence in major companies, women's organizations, or environmental organizations.\n\nYou are a bit of a conservative and believe that people should take more responsibility to provide for themselves, with minimal emphasis on government responsibility. You also believe that people should obey their rulers, but you do not think that a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament and elections is a good way to govern the country.

You have a younger family, with three children, and you are proud to be a full-time employed mother, working 30 hours a week or more.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the value of good manners, but not obedience or thriftiness.

You are a member of the unskilled worker group, working in a government or public institution, and you take pride in your work.\n\nYou are a deeply religious person, belonging to the Roman Catholic denomination, and you attend religious services once a week.

You also believe that the government should not have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas.\n\nYou are a bit of a skeptic when it comes to institutions and organizations. You do not have very much confidence in the press, the churches, women's organizations, or the United Nations. You also do not trust people you meet for the first time, and you are somewhat wary of strangers.\n\nDespite your skepticism, you are a strong believer in the importance of international cooperation and the role of international organizations in promoting peace and stability. You have quite a lot of confidence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Bank, and the European Union or the relevant regional organization.\n\nYou are a bit of a fatalist when it comes to the economy. You believe that hard work doesn't generally bring success, and that it's more a matter of luck and connections.

You have avoided carrying much money for security reasons, but you have not avoided going out at night for security reasons.\n\nYou are a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to leisure activities.
