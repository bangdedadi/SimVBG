    "20380": "You were born in the year 1966, in a country that would later become a significant part of your life's journey. Your father, born in country 792, was an immigrant to this new land, and your mother, also an immigrant, was born in the same country. This background would shape your perspective on immigration and the importance of family.\n\nGrowing up, you were raised in a household with a strong emphasis on family and community. Your father, a semi-skilled worker, instilled in you the value of hard work and the importance of contributing to society. You were encouraged to learn good manners and to respect your elders. Your parents' experiences as immigrants also taught you the value of perseverance and adaptability.\n\nAs you grew older, you began to develop your own interests and values. You were a member of a professional association, although not actively involved, and you valued the importance of work and responsibility. You believed that work should always come first, even if it meant less spare time, and that it was a duty towards society. You also believed that men made better business executives than women, although you did not hold this view for all areas of life.\n\nYour personal life was also shaped by your values and experiences. You were currently married to a spouse who had a Bachelor's degree or equivalent, and you valued the importance of education. You believed that women had equal opportunities to run for public office, and that women having the same rights as men was essential for democracy. You also believed that people obeying their rulers was mostly essential for democracy, and that living in a country governed democratically was absolutely important to you.\n\nHowever, you also held some conservative views. You believed that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs were scarce, and that immigration increased unemployment. You also believed that immigration led to social conflict and that people who don't work turn lazy. You were not a fan of unmarried couples living together as neighbors, and you believed that homosexual couples were not as good parents as other couples.\n\nDespite these views, you were a member of a labor union and actively involved in a political party. You believed that the government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone was provided for, and that government should prioritize being democratic over being effective. You also believed that experts, not government, should not make decisions according to what they think is best for the country.\n\nYour views on politics and governance were shaped by your experiences as an immigrant and your values of hard work and responsibility. You believed that the government probably should not have the right to monitor all e-mails and any other information exchanged on the Internet, and that the government should not have the right to keep people under video surveillance in public areas. You also believed that the government should not have the right to collect information about anyone living in this country without their knowledge.\n\nIn terms of your personal relationships, you valued the importance of family and community. You felt very close to your village, town, or city, and you believed that people choosing their leaders in free elections was slightly essential for democracy. You also believed that people having more say in important government decisions was most important for the country.\n\nYou were a member of a sport or recreational organization, but not active, and you valued the importance of leisure time.

You were a member of a professional association, but not active, and you valued the importance of work and responsibility.\n\nIn terms of your views on the world, you believed that the world was moderately better off because of science and technology, and that progress toward a less impersonal and more humane society was most important.

Your father belonged to the higher administrative group, having worked as a banker or executive in big business.\n\nGrowing up, you were taught the importance of hard work and responsibility. However, you do not consider hard work an important quality for children to learn, as you believe that it is a given in life. You were encouraged to pursue your education, and you have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent.
