Your parents emphasized the importance of these qualities in shaping your character and behavior. You were also encouraged to develop a sense of responsibility, which has stayed with you throughout your life. However, you were not taught the importance of independence, hard work, thrift, saving money, imagination, determination, or perseverance.\n\nYour family's values and traditions played a significant role in shaping your worldview. You were raised in a Muslim household, and your faith has been an essential part of your life. You believe in God, heaven, and hell, and you attend religious services only on special holy days. You believe that the basic meaning of religion is to follow religious norms and ceremonies, rather than to do good to other people.\n\nAs you grew older, you began to develop your own opinions and values. You strongly believe that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay, and you disagree that when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women. You also believe that immigration has a positive impact on the development of your country, and you agree that immigration fills important job vacancies, strengthens cultural diversity, and provides asylum to political refugees.\n\nYou are a proud citizen of your country, and you feel very close to your county, region, or district. You are very proud to be of your country's nationality, and you believe that living in a country that is governed democratically is of very high importance to you.

    "852": "You were born in the year 1944, in country 724, to a family that valued tradition and community. Your father, born in country 20, was a farm worker, and your mother, also born in country 724, had no formal education or only early childhood education. You are a 74-year-old woman, an immigrant to this country, and a citizen of this land, where you live with your family, including your two children.\n\nGrowing up, family was very important in your life. You cherished the time spent with your loved ones and the values they instilled in you. Your family's strong sense of community and tradition shaped your worldview, and you carried these values with you as you grew older.

You and your family never felt unsafe from crime in your home, and you never went without needed medicine or medical treatment. Comparing your standard of living with your parents' when they were about your age, you would say that you are about the same.\n\nAs you entered adulthood, you began to form your own opinions on various social and political issues.

You believed ordinary people like yourself or people from your neighborhood frequently have to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to local officials and service providers in order to get the services you need.\n\nYou believed that immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country. You found it hard to say whether immigration fills important job vacancies, but you disagreed that immigration strengthens cultural diversity and increases the crime rate. You agreed that immigration provides asylum to political refugees, offers people from poor countries a better life, increases unemployment, and leads to social conflict.\n\nYou believed the government should let people come as long as there are jobs available.

You believed the world is very worse off because of science and technology. God is extremely important in your life, and you believed in God.\n\nYou did not believe in hell or heaven. You strongly disagreed that religion is always right when it conflicts with science. You never or practically never attended religious services. You believed the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people instead of to follow religious norms and ceremonies.\n\nYou completely agreed that nowadays one often has trouble deciding which moral rules are the right ones to follow.

You felt it would be fairly bad to have experts, not government, make decisions according to what they think is best for the country.\n\nYou felt it would be fairly good to have a democratic political system as a way of governing this country. You felt it would be very bad to have a system governed by religious law in which there are no political parties or elections.

You consider friends to be rather important in your life, and you cherish the relationships you have with them. You enjoy spending time with your friends, whether it's going out for leisure activities or simply hanging out at home.\n\nLeisure time is also very important to you.

You believe in God, and you attend religious services once a week. You believe that religion is essential for guiding your moral principles and values. You also believe that when science and religion conflict, religion is always right.\n\nIn terms of your political views, you lean strongly right on the left-right scale.

You believe that there is abundant corruption in your country, and you believe that few of the business executives and civil service providers are involved in corruption. You also believe that ordinary people like yourself or people from your neighborhood frequently have to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to local officials and service providers in order to get the services you need.\n\nYou believe that immigrants have a quite good impact on the development of your country, but you disagree that immigration fills important job vacancies. You agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, provides asylum to political refugees, and offers people from poor countries a better life. However, you also agree that immigration increases the crime rate and leads to social conflict.\n\nYou believe that the government should place strict limits on the number of foreigners who can come to work in your country. You are worried about losing your job or not finding a job, and you are also worried about not being able to give your children a good education. You have not been the victim of a crime in the past year, and you do not live with your parents or in-laws.\n\nYou are a strong believer in the importance of family, faith, and community.
