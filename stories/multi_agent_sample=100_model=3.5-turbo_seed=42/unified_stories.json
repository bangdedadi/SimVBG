You also reject the idea that religious authorities should interpret the laws, finding such a system incompatible with democracy. Your secular views extend to your acceptance of different beliefs, as you do not mind having neighbors who practice a different religion, speak a different language, or even belong to a different nationality.\n\nAlthough you are not particularly religious, you hold strong convictions about moral issues. For instance, you believe that both men and women should be treated equally in the workplace and at home.

You believe that homosexuality is always justified, and that homosexual couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples.

You are not naive about the existence of corruption or inequality, but you believe in the power of gradual reforms to improve society. You have a slightly skeptical view of big corporations and banks, but you place significant trust in civil service organizations and the courts. You believe that there is a good deal of respect for individual rights in your country, and that voters are generally offered a genuine choice in elections. \n\nIn terms of your personal life, you are employed full-time, working 30 or more hours a week. You are the chief wage earner in your household, which consists of two people. You are also a mother of three children, and although you are not particularly focused on making your parents proud, you do value raising your children with important life skills, such as a sense of responsibility and imagination. You do not believe that hard work is an essential quality for children to learn, and you do not consider good manners or religious faith to be particularly important in children's upbringing.\n\nYour financial situation is relatively stable, as you belong to the eighth highest income group in your country. Your family saved money in the past year, and you have never experienced a lack of cash income or had trouble with crime. While your neighborhood is peaceful, you are aware that crime, violence, and alcohol consumption do not occur in your area, contributing to your sense of security.\n\nDespite your success and security, you are not entirely content with the system as it is. You feel that the political system in your country can improve and that progress is best achieved through reforms rather than a sudden overhaul. You also have a strong commitment to ensuring that everyone in your society is treated with fairness and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. \n\nOverall, you are satisfied with your life, though you believe there is room for improvement.

    "3906": "You were born in 1972, in a country that holds a significant place in your life, and you take pride in your nationality. Your family history is diverse, as your father was born in Country 36, while your mother immigrated to this country. Your upbringing was shaped by a working-class background, with your father belonging to the semi-skilled worker group, like a bus driver or carpenter.\n\nAt 45 years old, you're self-employed, serving as the chief wage earner in your household. You live alone, with no one else in your immediate household, and you've never experienced a lack of food or safe shelter in the past year. Financially, you belong to the second-lowest income group in your country and have sometimes gone without a cash income during the past year. Despite this, you manage a relatively stable standard of living, which you feel compares similarly to that of your parents when they were your age.\n\nYou value work deeply, believing that it is not just a personal duty but a duty towards society. You would never join a strike, and you believe that work should always come first, even if it means sacrificing spare time. Work is important in your life, but you also agree that leisure time holds some significance for your well-being.\n\nFriends and family are central to your life. You value your friends highly, regularly discussing political matters with them, though you are not a member of any political party or any humanitarian, charitable, or professional organization. You don't believe in the importance of imagination or independence as qualities for children to learn but do emphasize qualities such as responsibility, hard work, and good manners for the younger generation. Family is very important to you, and you strongly agree that adult children have the duty to provide long-term care for their parents. You are also a proud father of two children and strongly believe that one of your main life goals has been to make your parents proud.\n\nYou are divorced, and your views on relationships and family life can sometimes seem complex. You would never justify cheating on taxes, stealing, or any form of violence, but you believe in the justification of divorce and euthanasia when necessary. You think that adults should have the freedom to make their own decisions, including engaging in casual sex and having relationships outside of marriage. You also hold that women should have equal rights to run for public office and that the idea of men being better business executives or political leaders than women is flawed. However, you would not like to have homosexuals or people with AIDS as neighbors, although you believe that homosexuality is somewhat justified and agree that immigration offers people from poor countries a better life.\n\nPolitically, you have a mixed and somewhat skeptical stance on many issues. You believe in a democratic system of government but are deeply critical of the current political system in your country, feeling that it is functioning poorly. You do not trust the government, the press, or international organizations such as the United Nations or the World Bank, and you have little confidence in banks, major companies, or the courts. You believe the government should have the right to monitor emails and surveillance in public areas, but at the same time, you are cautious about the idea of the state collecting personal information without people's knowledge.\n\nYou view democracy as important but with caveats. You believe that people choosing their leaders through free elections is essential, but you don't have much faith that elections are always fair or that votes are counted properly. You feel it would be bad if there were a leader who did not need to worry about parliament or elections. You are also somewhat concerned about the government’s role in monitoring private lives and are wary of state overreach. In terms of priorities, you feel that having strong defense forces should be one of the country’s main goals, but that economic growth and fighting rising prices are more important.\n\nIn your community, crime is not a major issue. You have never felt unsafe from crime in your home, and robberies or street violence do not frequently occur in your neighborhood. However, you have avoided going out at night for security reasons, and you do believe that immigration could lead to social conflict and a rise in crime. You also agree that immigration should be limited and that the government should prioritize people from your country over immigrants, particularly when jobs are scarce. You don’t believe that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, and you would prefer fewer foreigners in your country, especially in terms of work.\n\nReligiously, you describe yourself as non-denominational and do not believe in hell, heaven, or life after death. While you believe in God to some extent, religion is not a major part of your life, and you rarely attend religious services or pray. You strongly disagree with the idea that religion should always be right in conflicts with science, and you believe that scientific and technological progress has greatly benefited society. However, you do have a moderate interest in science and its application in daily life, though you feel that science is not as critical as other factors, like hard work, in improving people’s lives.\n\nYou are skeptical about the media, believing that the press does not often provide fair coverage of elections or favor the governing party. You think that journalists, like most civil service providers, are generally not corrupt. You do, however, have quite a lot of confidence in environmental organizations, universities, and charitable or humanitarian organizations, even though you're not a member of any of these.\n\nYou do not consider yourself very close to your continent, nor do you feel particularly attached to your neighborhood or region. Instead, you focus on your country and town, and you are more concerned with practical matters like economic growth and stable governance than with broader ideological issues. You would never encourage online political actions or protests, preferring more traditional forms of civic engagement, such as signing petitions or contacting government officials directly. You occasionally consider joining a boycott but have never done so yet.\n\nOverall, you would describe your life as fairly good and are moderately satisfied with your circumstances. You view life as a blend of opportunities and challenges, and though you may have certain reservations about society, you are generally optimistic about personal effort leading to a better future.

Despite your family’s relatively modest economic standing in recent times, you have never gone without enough food or shelter, nor has your family been the victim of any crime in the past year. \n\nIn terms of beliefs, religion plays a significant role in your life, as you belong to the Roman Catholic denomination and strongly believe in God. You pray several times a day and consider religious faith an important quality for children to learn. However, you also feel that the basic meaning of religion is to do good for others, not merely to follow religious norms and ceremonies. You are quite firm in your belief that your religion is the only acceptable one, and you find it difficult to say whether science or religion should prevail when they conflict. In these cases, you always believe that religion is right. Although religion is important to you, you never attend religious services regularly. Your views on other religions are less tolerant, as you do not trust people of different religions very much and would not like to have people of another religion as neighbors.\n\nWhen it comes to your political views, you place yourself at the center of the political spectrum. You are not affiliated with any political party, and you do not engage in political activities or protests, either online or in person. You find that political discussions with friends are not something you partake in, and you avoid discussing political matters with them. You believe the government should not have the right to monitor emails or collect information on individuals, as you feel privacy is essential. You are quite critical of the government and do not have much confidence in it, nor do you trust the civil service, police, or courts. Furthermore, you are concerned about political violence and the fairness of elections, believing that votes are not often counted fairly and election officials are not always impartial. You would vote for another party if a national election were held tomorrow, though you do not typically vote in national elections. \n\nRegarding your views on democracy, you support a system where the country is governed by democratic principles, but you also believe in a strong leader who doesn’t have to be burdened with the processes of parliament or elections. You find it important that citizens choose their leaders through free elections, although you believe the army taking over when the government is incompetent is crucial for democracy. However, you are somewhat skeptical about certain aspects of democracy, like the role of political parties and elections, and you feel that some elements, such as civil rights protecting individuals from state oppression, are slightly less essential. You would like to see a democratic system, but with more emphasis on the role of experts over political representatives. You also feel that democracy should provide for its citizens, which means greater government responsibility, though you believe economic growth should be a priority for your country over the next decade.\n\nWhile you value friends and family greatly, you place a high importance on work. You believe that hard work brings a better life and that people should strive to do their best, as you strongly agree that individual effort should be incentivized. You strongly feel that work should always come first, even if it means sacrificing leisure time. This focus on work extends to your beliefs about society, where you feel work is crucial to a country’s functioning and should not be minimized. You disagree that a high level of work should be balanced with less importance on leisure or personal freedom. In this regard, you disagree with the notion that immigration negatively impacts job availability, and you also do not think it increases unemployment. Additionally, you do not agree that men should have more job opportunities than women in times of scarcity, and you believe that women often have equal opportunities to run for public office.\n\nYou are cautious about the outside world, as you do not trust people you meet for the first time very much. Despite this, you value family above all else, and your personal life has revolved around caring for and making your parents proud. As a housewife, you focus on managing your home, and while you do not hold any paid employment, you do contribute significantly to the family unit. Your views on gender are relatively traditional, as you believe that men and women should not be seen as equals in every domain. This extends to your belief that a university education is more important for a boy than a girl, and your stance on the importance of work, where men should lead in terms of career progression.\n\nYou also harbor certain biases regarding neighbors, particularly those of different sexual orientations, nationalities, and religions. You would not be comfortable having homosexuals, drug addicts, or people from a different religion as neighbors. However, you do not mind having neighbors who speak a different language or have AIDS. You are not actively involved in any charities, women’s groups, or self-help organizations, preferring instead to focus on your family, work, and religious beliefs. You would never encourage others to participate in political activities or protests, and you do not sign petitions or engage in strikes.\n\nIn terms of social issues, you believe that women and men should have equal opportunities, but you strongly oppose homosexuality and casual sex, as well as any form of sexual misconduct like wife-beating or prostitution. You find such behaviors entirely unjustifiable. While you support a strong social fabric, you are concerned about the lack of respect for individual human rights in the country, particularly with regards to state oppression. You also feel that there is a lack of respect for democratic processes, and that elections are neither fair nor representative.\n\nOn a personal level, you are quite satisfied with your life, and you would say that your standard of living is better than your parents’ was at your age. You believe your country should work towards greater economic growth, more efficient use of resources, and better management of technology to improve living standards. Despite all these beliefs, you remain cautious about embracing too many changes, preferring a gradual improvement of society and a return to more traditional values.",

You also somewhat believe that immigration can increase unemployment but do not think it raises crime rates.\n\nFamily is very important to you, and you place a strong value on raising children with the right values.

You are skeptical of the press, major companies, and the civil service, and you have no trust in banks, courts, or parliament.

You also believe that taxes should be used to help subsidize the poor, though not to an extreme extent.\n\nYou consider work to be quite important in your life, though you do not feel that work should always come first, even if it means sacrificing free time.

You disagree that work is a duty towards society and that men are generally better business leaders than women. You also strongly disagree with the idea that men are better political leaders.\n\nYour trust in people is cautious, and you admit to being more skeptical of strangers and new acquaintances. You would never encourage others to take political action or join protests online, and you trust people you know personally only somewhat. While you don’t have much confidence in various institutions or organizations, you do value honest journalism and think that reporters provide fair coverage of elections. However, you think there is a lot of corruption among business executives and that the press sometimes favors the governing party.\n\nYou are a retired pensioner, not involved in any formal associations or humanitarian groups, and you do not engage in political activities, either online or offline. You do, however, find that friendships are rather important in your life, and you engage with others to get information through conversations. Even though you do not have very much confidence in television, you do use it as a primary source of information.\n\nYou are someone who places significant importance on the well-being and safety of your community. You feel secure in your environment, where crime is low, and there is no significant violence. Your neighborhood is free of issues like drug sales, street violence, and theft. Your confidence in the police is relatively high, and you trust your neighborhood somewhat.\n\nLastly, you see the world as one in which moral decisions can be complex, and you agree that it is difficult to know the right moral rules to follow.

You also strongly believe that the government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for.\n\nWhen it comes to democracy, you hold some non-traditional views. You believe that living in a country governed democratically is of very low importance to you, and you feel that the country is not at all democratic in how it is governed today. You would feel it would be fairly bad to have a democratic political system as the governing method in your country. You don’t believe that voting and free elections are essential characteristics of a democracy and that the state making people's incomes equal is mostly not essential either.

You feel that women are more likely to suffer when they work for pay, and that children suffer as a result of their mother working.\n\nYour social life is focused around your friends and family. You trust people you know personally completely, and while you are cautious with strangers, you do trust people you meet for the first time somewhat.

    "36422": "You were born in 1968, in this country, where you have spent most of your life. Your roots are deeply connected to your nation, and you are very proud to be of your country’s nationality. You were raised in a family where both of your parents were born here. Your father worked in the sales industry as a shop owner, and your mother completed primary education. While your family was never deprived of food or shelter in the last 12 months, you were very mindful of your security, avoiding carrying much money and not feeling unsafe from crime in your home or neighborhood.\n\nAt the age of 50, you are currently employed full-time, working 30 hours a week or more. You belong to the middle-income group in your country and consider yourself part of the working class. You have 4 children, and family is extremely important in your life. Your spouse, who has never had a job, completed upper secondary education. Together, you live with your spouse and children in a household of four. Your role as the chief wage earner shapes much of your life, and you take great pride in your ability to provide for your family.\n\nYou are a religious person and place great importance on faith. You belong to the Muslim denomination, and your faith plays a significant role in your life. You attend religious services more than once a week, pray several times a day, and believe that God is extremely important to you (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You also strongly agree that your religion is the only acceptable one. You consider religious faith an important quality for children to learn, and you are committed to ensuring they grow up understanding the importance of religion. For you, the basic meaning of religion is to follow religious norms and ceremonies rather than merely doing good to others. \n\nIn terms of your political beliefs, you describe yourself as very strongly right-leaning (position 9 on the left-right scale). You are not a member of any political party and do not have much trust in the government or in parliament, though you are confident in international organizations like NATO, the United Nations, and the World Health Organization. You are skeptical of the media, feeling that TV news often favors the governing party in your country. You trust the press to some degree, but not overwhelmingly. You don’t have much confidence in civil services, banks, or the police, and you believe there’s corruption within these institutions. You believe that the government should have limited surveillance powers, though you also think video surveillance in public areas might be justifiable. \n\nYour views on democracy are nuanced.

You hold a high regard for democracy’s role in ensuring civil rights and gender equality, and you would say that living in a country governed democratically is of extremely high importance to you (level 9 on a scale of 1-10). You believe in free elections and that it is essential for people to have a say in choosing their leaders. However, you feel that the country’s current democracy could improve, as you would rate the country's governance as only fairly democratic (level 7 on a scale of 1-10).\n\nThough you value democracy, you also have some reservations about immigration. You believe that immigration increases the crime rate and that the government should place strict limits on the number of foreigners who can come to work. You think that immigration may lead to social conflict, and you don’t feel that it necessarily provides a better life for people from poor countries. Additionally, you believe that the number of immigrants should be controlled to ensure the country remains stable and that foreigners shouldn’t have the same rights as locals when jobs are scarce. While you agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, you have concerns about its impact on the country’s social fabric.\n\nYou don’t hold much trust in strangers and tend to be cautious in dealing with people, which is reflected in your more conservative views on immigration and personal security. You believe that people receiving state aid for unemployment is only slightly essential to democracy, and you generally believe that government should take more responsibility in ensuring that everyone is provided for. However, you believe that hard work doesn’t guarantee success, attributing more importance to luck and connections than to individual effort.\n\nOn social issues, you believe in traditional values. You feel that casual sex, premarital sex, and homosexuality are almost never justified. You also believe that women and men should have equal opportunities, but you remain skeptical about the role of women in leadership. You don’t mind unmarried couples living together as neighbors, but you do not want to have homosexuals, drug addicts, or heavy drinkers as neighbors. Similarly, you have no problem with people of different races or languages living nearby but would be less comfortable with people of a different religion.\n\nThough you rarely get involved in political protests or activism, you occasionally discuss political matters with friends, and you might consider signing a petition or boycott. You believe in the power of competition and feel it’s a good thing, yet you also think it’s important for the government to prioritize maintaining order and ensuring economic growth above all else. You are not particularly active in social causes but do belong to a humanitarian organization, even if not actively participating. You also consider good manners, responsibility, and religious faith to be essential qualities for children to learn.\n\nYou are generally satisfied with your life (level 9 on a scale of 1-10), though you believe that your life’s success has more to do with luck than hard work. Your health is fair, and you remain active in your community, even if you are not heavily involved in community organizations. You are confident in institutions like the World Bank, the IMF, and the International Criminal Court, and you trust that charitable organizations can make a difference in the world. However, you remain cautious and guarded in most of your interactions, especially with people from other nationalities or religions.\n\nIn conclusion, you are a devout and cautious individual, deeply rooted in your national and religious identity.

At the same time, you have concerns about immigration, social conflict, and the role of government in ensuring social and economic stability.

While you agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, you also believe it increases the crime rate, and you would prioritize giving local people jobs over immigrants when jobs are scarce. You are not fond of having neighbors who are homosexuals or heavy drinkers, and you are particularly wary of people with AIDS, drug addicts, or criminals. Additionally, you do not mind having neighbors of a different race, religion, or language, as long as they do not engage in behaviors that you consider problematic.\n\nIn terms of your general outlook on life, you would describe your current state of health as fair.

In your opinion, a stable economy is the most important goal for your country, and you consider maintaining order in the nation to be crucial. However, you feel that voters are usually offered a genuine choice in elections, and you believe that a strong defense force should be the second most important goal for the country over the next decade.\n\nYou also believe that respect for individual human rights is important in your country, although you don't think that everyone has an equal opportunity to run for public office. You would not want the government to collect information about people without their knowledge, and you also believe that the government should not have the right to monitor all e-mails or collect surveillance data on private individuals.\n\nDespite your skepticism about some aspects of politics, you do have strong opinions about what constitutes a good society. You believe that terrorism, political violence, and other forms of aggression are never justified. You consider progress toward a less impersonal and more humane society to be one of the most important goals. You are also worried about the potential for a terrorist attack or a war involving your country, although you remain fairly confident in your ability to protect yourself and your family from crime. \n\nUltimately, while you have some reservations about political and societal structures, you believe that things are generally going well in your country.

However, you do place a significant amount of confidence in the armed forces, police, civil service, and courts. You trust these institutions more than the press, media, or parliament, which you believe may often be involved in corruption.\n\nYou also have clear opinions on various social issues. You strongly agree that stealing property, terrorism, and violence against others are never justified. You believe that men and women should have equal rights, and you see women running for public office as very common in your country. You do not think that men make better business executives or political leaders than women, and you disagree with the idea that women working for pay harms children. On the other hand, you think that parents should provide long-term care for their children and that divorce is often justified.\n\nAlthough you are open-minded about some social issues, such as unmarried couples living together or having people of different races or sexual orientations as neighbors, you do not particularly value the importance of good manners, imagination, or independence in children. You are neutral on the subject of whether homosexual couples are as good parents as other couples, and you are somewhat critical of casual sex and prostitution. You do not consider the belief in hard work, responsibility, or imagination important qualities for children to learn.\n\nYou do not trust people you meet for the first time and feel that being cautious with others is necessary. You believe that people should take more responsibility for themselves, with minimal reliance on government. You also believe that science and technology have a modest but positive impact on making life healthier and more comfortable, though you think that science is not central to your daily life.\n\nYour views on government surveillance and internet privacy are somewhat contradictory. You believe the government should have the right to monitor emails and other communications but also feel that it is a violation of privacy for them to collect information on citizens without their knowledge. You are not particularly concerned about terrorism or a potential war involving your country, though you would be willing to fight for your country if necessary.\n\nIn terms of your neighborhood and social environment, you feel quite close to your city, village, or district, yet you are aware of the issues that affect your area, such as drug sales, robberies, and frequent alcohol consumption. You are not very concerned about street violence or social conflict, but you find it difficult to assess the impact of immigration on social issues, including crime and unemployment.\n\nYour beliefs about social values are centered on personal responsibility, work ethic, and security. You strongly believe in the importance of freedom over equality, though you consider security more important than freedom when it comes to making difficult choices.

You also believe in the importance of honest elections and the right to vote, and you make it a point to vote in national elections consistently. \n\nWhile your family saved money last year, you are skeptical about charitable organizations, banks, and large companies, though you trust the civil service and believe in maintaining a strong economy. You feel that maintaining law and order is of the utmost importance, and you place a high priority on ensuring your country has a strong defense.

You live in an environment where street violence, alcohol consumption, and robberies do not occur, and your neighborhood is free from incidents such as police or military interference with private life, racism, and drug sales. You feel quite secure these days, and you’ve never felt unsafe from crime in your home.\n\nReligion holds no significant importance in your life. You are not a member of any religious denomination, and you have never attended religious services. You do not believe in God, hell, or heaven, and religion does not play a role in your daily decisions or values. While religion is not important to you, you do not mind having people of different religions, races, or sexual orientations as neighbors. In fact, you strongly believe that homosexual couples are as good parents as other couples, and you do not mind unmarried couples living together as neighbors.\n\nYou place a high value on family and friends, and they play an important role in your life. You have never had children, but you do feel that having children is a duty towards society. However, you do not consider good manners or religious faith to be essential qualities for children to learn. You also consider the feeling of responsibility an important quality for children to learn. You are not a member of any self-help, mutual aid, or women’s group, and you do not belong to any political party or professional association. However, you have signed petitions before and might sign electronic petitions or organize political activities online.\n\nAlthough you are not a very political person and do not regularly engage in political discussions, you occasionally talk about political matters with your friends. Your political views lean slightly left, and you believe that a democratic political system is the best way to govern your country. You have quite a lot of confidence in the government, as well as in political institutions such as the press, parliament, and courts. You are satisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country and strongly agree that living in a country governed democratically is absolutely essential to you.\n\nIn terms of governance, you believe that civil rights protecting individuals from state oppression are essential for democracy, as well as having free and honest elections. You also value the importance of a free press, and you believe the media provides fair coverage of elections fairly often. Although you think political violence is rarely justified, you strongly disagree with the idea that a strong leader who does not need to bother with parliament and elections would be a good way to govern your country.\n\nYou feel that there should be some limits placed on immigration, particularly regarding foreigners coming to work in your country. You agree that immigration strengthens cultural diversity, but you also believe it can lead to social conflict. You feel that immigration can help fill important job vacancies, but you are not sure about the impact it has on unemployment or crime rates. You trust people from other nationalities or religions only somewhat, and you think that strict limits should be imposed on the number of foreigners allowed to work in your country.\n\nWhen it comes to economic issues, you are focused on achieving a stable economy and high economic growth. You consider a stable economy to be the second most important goal for your country over the next ten years, right after having more say for people in how things are done at their jobs and in their communities.

You think work is important, but you also do not mind if there was less emphasis on it in society. You consider leisure time to be essential in your life, and you strongly believe that it is a duty to society to work, but you do not agree with the notion that hard work is the only path to success—luck and connections also play a role. Work is very important to you, and you are employed full-time, working 30 or more hours a week.\n\nYou believe that a system in which there are no political parties or elections, governed entirely by religious law, would be very bad. You value political participation and democratic ideals and strongly support the idea that people should choose their leaders in free elections. You do not mind if there was more emphasis placed on technology development, and you agree that governments should slightly prioritize being effective over being democratic.\n\nYou are a rather happy person overall, with good health and a strong belief in personal responsibility. You moderately disagree with the idea that society depends too much on science and not enough on faith, but you feel that modern society has made progress toward a more humane and less impersonal way of life. You somewhat believe that people should take more responsibility for themselves, but you also think government should play a role in this.\n\nYour country has made strides in protecting individual rights, and you strongly believe that women having the same rights as men is absolutely essential for a democracy. You also believe that having honest elections and giving people more say in important decisions are essential characteristics of democracy.

You are somewhat interested in politics and occasionally discuss political matters with your friends.

You believe that people from other countries should be allowed to come to work as long as there are jobs available, but you disagree with the idea that immigration fills important job vacancies or provides asylum to political refugees.

You do not feel very close to any specific political or social groups, and you do not take part in protests or encourage others to do so.

You also think that women often have fewer opportunities to run for public office.\n\nYou also hold strong views about government surveillance, agreeing that the government should have the right to monitor all e-mails and collect information about individuals without their knowledge. However, you do not think that protecting civil rights from state oppression or guaranteeing equal income distribution is essential to democracy. You strongly support increasing government ownership of business and industry and believe that people who are caught cheating on taxes, stealing, or accepting bribes should never be justified.\n\nOn a personal level, you describe your state of health as good and have no major concerns about your well-being. You are not a member of any sports, professional, or recreational organization, and you do not have very much confidence in the civil service or courts. While you do not trust people you meet for the first time very much, you trust people you know personally to some extent.\n\nOverall, you are somewhat satisfied with your life (6/10), but you feel there is much room for improvement.

You attend religious services weekly and pray several times a day. You strongly believe in God, and you describe religious faith as an important quality for children to learn. For you, the basic meaning of religion is to follow religious norms and ceremonies, rather than simply doing good for others. You also firmly believe that your religion is the only acceptable one. Your father was born in this country, and your mother was also born here, though she has completed only primary education. Your father belonged to the unskilled worker group, much like your spouse, who also falls into this category as a laborer. \n\nIn your family, religion and family values are of utmost importance. You are married and have three children. Your family is a central aspect of your life, and you hold the belief that it is a duty towards society to have children. You strongly agree that one of your main goals in life has been to make your parents proud. Despite the traditional importance of family, you also feel that your independence is important, which is why you consider it essential for children to learn this quality.\n\nYou are quite confident in various organizations, including the World Bank, the civil service, and the World Health Organization. You also place a great deal of trust in the International Criminal Court and have confidence in environmental organizations, banks, and major companies. However, your trust in the press, television, and parliament is much lower. You feel that the media often favors the governing party, especially in the case of TV news, and you have little confidence in the fairness of the press. Moreover, you disagree with the idea that the press provides fair coverage of elections in your country.\n\nYou are politically active but not aligned with any political party. Although you are not a member of any self-help or mutual aid group, you are involved in humanitarian and charitable organizations, as well as a women's group. You strongly believe that the government should monitor emails and other internet communications and that the government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for. You have a great deal of confidence in the government, and you believe that it should prioritize security over freedom in some cases. You support the idea that the state should collect information about its citizens without their knowledge, although you also think that privacy should be protected in some cases, like when people are under surveillance in public areas.\n\nIn terms of political views, you lean strongly to the right. You believe that votes should be counted fairly and that elections should offer a genuine choice for voters. You consider it essential to have a democratic political system in your country, and you think that it’s important for governments to tax the rich and subsidize the poor. However, you also believe in the importance of having a strong defense force to ensure national security, and you feel that maintaining order in the nation is crucial. Although you feel that democracy is vital, you are concerned about immigration and its impact on society.

While you agree that society needs to be more humane, you also feel that there is a need for radical change. You believe that hard work doesn’t always lead to success, and that luck and connections are more important.

You feel that social progress, particularly toward a less impersonal and more humane society, should be a major goal for the future.\n\nYou are generally satisfied with your life, rating your overall happiness quite high, though you also believe that a stable economy and strong defense are essential. You are somewhat interested in politics and occasionally discuss political matters with your friends.

You pray several times a day, attend religious services more than once a week, and you view religion as the foundation of your moral compass, considering it to be the guiding principle for norms and ceremonies rather than purely to do good for others. Your religious beliefs are so significant to you that you strongly agree your religion is the only acceptable one.\n\nYour family’s economic background is somewhat modest, as your father was a skilled worker, and your mother completed only primary education. Despite this, you consider yourself to belong to the upper middle class. Over the years, you've worked hard to build a stable life, and you consider hard work and responsibility as essential qualities for children to learn. You also strongly agree that work is a duty towards society, and you believe work should always come first, even if it means sacrificing spare time.\n\nYou are currently employed full-time, working at least 30 hours a week, and you consider your standard of living to be better than that of your parents at a similar age.

You believe a democratic political system would be beneficial for your country, and you are proud of your country's democratic process, rating it an 8 out of 10 in terms of how democratic it is. However, you do not fully trust the press or politicians. You have no confidence in the government, the United Nations, or any international financial organizations like the IMF or World Bank, and you do not trust major companies or banks.

You are not a member of any political party, labor union, or humanitarian organization, and you prefer not to discuss politics with friends.

However, you do not mind having people of different religions or languages as neighbors. Immigration, for you, is a complex issue. You agree that immigration provides asylum to political refugees and strengthens cultural diversity, but you also believe it can increase the crime rate and lead to social conflict. You feel somewhat ambivalent about whether immigration fills important job vacancies and whether it leads to a better life for those coming from poorer countries.\n\nYour views on gender roles are traditional. You strongly agree that men make better business executives and political leaders than women do, and you believe women do not often have equal opportunities to run for public office in your country. You think that when a woman earns more money than her husband, it is almost certain to cause problems, and you consider the idea of divorce to be never justified.\n\nYou are very concerned about political violence, terrorism, and potential wars. You feel strongly that political violence is never justified and that terrorism as a political, ideological, or religious means is almost never justified. You worry about potential wars involving your country and believe it is a duty to fight for your country in such a scenario. You also strongly agree that your country should maintain strong defense forces as one of its top priorities.\n\nRegarding social and moral values, you hold very strict views. You believe that stealing, casual sex, and cheating on taxes are never justified. Similarly, you believe that prostitution, sex before marriage, and avoiding fares on public transport are never justified. You view crime and corruption as significant issues, particularly within the civil service and among business executives, and you place high importance on upholding the rule of law and ensuring that government officials are held accountable.\n\nIn terms of your life satisfaction, you are generally somewhat content. You describe yourself as \"rather happy\" and are somewhat satisfied with your life as a whole, although you do believe that there could be greater respect for individual human rights.

Your father worked in the farm labor sector, and you were raised in a lower-middle-class environment, which has influenced your perspective on various aspects of life. You are now 59 years old and employed full-time, working over 30 hours per week. You consider yourself the chief wage earner in your household, which includes two people—yourself and your spouse.\n\nYou describe yourself as belonging to the lower-middle class and have completed only lower secondary education. Despite this, you are quite proud of your country and feel a deep connection to it, both as a nation and a region. Your village, town, or city is important to you, and you are quite satisfied with your life, generally speaking. You are somewhat happy with how the political system in your country is functioning (level 7 on a scale of 1-10) and would describe your health these days as good.\n\nIn your personal life, family is paramount. You are married and have two children, with your spouse being part of the semi-skilled worker group, similar to you. You are very committed to your family, and you view your role as the head of the household with a sense of responsibility. However, your relationship with your parents is not characterized by a desire to make them proud. You feel that family provides a sense of security, as you or your family have never gone without enough food, shelter, or income in the past year.\n\nPolitically, you lean moderately left, placing your views at position 3 on the left-right scale. You are not a member of any political party or any other type of organization, but you occasionally discuss politics with friends. You do not belong to any religious denomination, and religion plays very little role in your life, though you do not outright reject the notion of religion being a force for good. You are not particularly interested in the debates surrounding scientific or technological advancement, but you do recognize that these areas have made your life healthier, easier, and more comfortable. You believe that science and technology contribute positively to society, ranking the impact at level 8 on a scale of 1-10.\n\nRegarding your political beliefs, you believe democracy is a crucial aspect of governance and consider living in a democratic society to be absolutely important. You strongly agree with the importance of free elections and the right to choose leaders through those elections. You feel that the government should not monitor emails or collect information about individuals without their knowledge, and you express skepticism about the extent of governmental surveillance, including video surveillance in public spaces. Your level of trust in the government, police, and civil service is quite low, and you do not believe the government or major companies are free from corruption.\n\nYou are not particularly trusting of other people, either, especially those you meet for the first time, or people of other nationalities or religions. You are somewhat wary of immigrants, particularly their impact on the local economy and society. While you agree that immigration fills important job vacancies, you believe that there should be strict limits on the number of foreigners allowed into the country. Additionally, you feel that immigration can increase social conflict, and you worry about its potential effects on crime rates and the country's development. You also somewhat believe that competition in the economy can be harmful, though you acknowledge some of its benefits.\n\nYour views on issues of social justice and equality are nuanced. While you agree that women should have equal rights to run for public office, you do not see gender as a defining characteristic in terms of leadership ability. You disagree with the notion that men make better business executives or political leaders than women. You also reject the idea that religion should dictate legal interpretations or that religious law should govern a country in the absence of political parties or elections. However, you do agree with some traditional viewpoints—such as the idea that work is a duty toward society and that adults have a responsibility to care for their aging parents.\n\nYou hold some conservative social values, including a strong belief that violence, especially domestic violence, is never justified. You believe that a man beating his wife is unacceptable and consider any form of theft to be unjustifiable. You also do not see the justification for prostitution or homosexuality, though you are more open-minded in certain areas, such as not minding unmarried couples or those of different religions as neighbors.\n\nWhen it comes to societal issues, you believe that individual responsibility plays an essential role in democracy. However, you also think the government should have a role in protecting the welfare of its citizens. You somewhat believe that there should be incentives for individual effort, with a balance toward income equality. You are wary of unemployment, and though you do not believe men should have more rights to jobs than women, you feel that priority should be given to citizens over immigrants when jobs are scarce. You also think that greater emphasis on technology development may not always be beneficial.\n\nThough you believe in a democratic system of government, you are not optimistic about certain institutions, such as the press or parliament. You have a fair amount of confidence in organizations like the United Nations, environmental groups, and the International Criminal Court, but you do not trust the media or political leaders to always act in the public's best interest. You would not hesitate to participate in peaceful demonstrations or sign petitions, though you have not yet taken action in that direction. Additionally, you feel strongly about having strong defense forces for your country, and would be willing to fight in the event of war, despite hoping that such a scenario never comes to pass.\n\nIn your community, you have never felt unsafe from crime, and you live in a neighborhood with minimal issues regarding street violence, alcohol consumption, or drug sales. You do not mind having people who speak a different language or come from different races as neighbors, though you would not want to live near drug addicts, heavy drinkers, or those with AIDS. Your views on social conflicts and challenges seem rooted in a deep concern for order and security, while balancing the importance of individual freedom and responsibility.\n\nIn sum, you are someone who values freedom, security, and democracy. While you are cautious and somewhat distrustful of others, especially strangers and foreign influences, you care deeply about your country and your family. You have a strong sense of duty toward society, believing that work and personal responsibility are essential components of a healthy and functioning nation.",

You feel that the government should place strict limits on the number of immigrants allowed to work in the country. You also agree that immigration increases unemployment and may contribute to rising crime rates. Additionally, you support the idea of prioritizing citizens for job opportunities, especially during times of economic scarcity. Despite these concerns, you remain open to the idea of offering asylum to political refugees.\n\nYour views on religion are fairly secular. You do not belong to any religious denomination, and religion is not at all important in your life. You do not believe in God, hell, or heaven, and you rarely pray. While you respect people of other religions and do not mind having them as neighbors, you do not think that religion plays a significant role in your daily life. You believe that the primary purpose of religion is to do good to others, rather than to follow religious norms and ceremonies. You also disagree with the idea that religion should have any authority in political matters, and you oppose religious law governing society. In your household, religion plays no significant role, and your children are not taught religious faith as an important quality.\n\nWhen it comes to your views on social issues, you hold moderate beliefs. You are somewhat open-minded about issues like casual sex, divorce, and the role of women in society, though you believe that work should always come first, even if it means sacrificing leisure time. You believe that competition is beneficial but place a strong emphasis on the importance of hard work, responsibility, and good manners in children. You are not particularly interested in the idea of social conflict arising from gender or racial issues, though you would prefer to live in a neighborhood where there is no alcohol consumption or drug-related activity.\n\nYour attitude toward the economy is pragmatic. You consider a stable economy to be one of the most important goals for your country, and you think that rising prices and economic growth should be the primary focus of the government. You support a system that balances both private and government ownership, with a slight preference for private ownership. You also feel that there should be minimal support for income equality, with greater incentives for individual effort. You trust in major companies, banks, and the civil service, though you are cautious about corruption, particularly in the media and among business executives.\n\nYou trust people you know personally completely, but you are slightly wary of strangers and people from other nationalities. You find it difficult to trust people who are not directly in your circle, and you also trust people of different religions only somewhat. Your attitude towards people from different backgrounds is largely neutral, though you prefer not to have neighbors who are homosexuals, drug addicts, or heavy drinkers.\n\nYou are concerned about global issues such as terrorism, the impact of science and technology, and the role of international organizations. You do not have strong confidence in the World Health Organization, but you do trust organizations like the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and the World Bank. You also believe that international organizations should prioritize democracy over efficiency and that the fight against crime is second in importance to fighting rising prices.\n\nWhile you are somewhat satisfied with the political system in your country, you believe that there is room for improvement, particularly when it comes to democracy and freedom. You place high value on individual rights and freedoms, including the right to privacy, and you are opposed to the government overreaching into personal lives. You strongly support the idea of universal civil rights, equal opportunities for all citizens, and the importance of maintaining a balance between freedom and security.\n\nIn your personal life, you place great importance on family. You are married and value the close relationships you have with your spouse and children.

However, you admit that you do not trust people of another religion, nationality, or who you meet for the first time.

You feel close to your city and country but have little to no emotional connection to your continent.

You also believe immigration can have a positive impact on your country's development, but you hold concerns about its potential to increase crime rates.\n\nYou are cautious about people you don’t know and trust very few individuals, whether they are from your country or another.

Similarly, you have little faith in the civil service, the police, or the government.\n\nRegarding social matters, you are generally tolerant, expressing that you do not mind having neighbors of different races, religions, or sexual orientations.

In terms of your relationship with science and technology, you see their contributions to society as overwhelmingly positive, especially when it comes to making life healthier and more comfortable.

You might even attend a peaceful demonstration or sign a petition for a cause you believe in.\n\nRegarding immigration, you have a nuanced view. You believe that immigration provides important job opportunities and cultural diversity, but you also think it can lead to social conflict.

You are also not worried about a terrorist attack or political violence, though you are somewhat concerned about the potential for war.

You also think that having a strong leader without a parliament or elections would be a very bad idea.\n\nIn terms of lifestyle, you have a strong belief in the importance of science and technology. You believe that technological progress has improved people's lives and should continue to be a priority for the country. You also think that leisure time is very important, and that work should not always take precedence over personal well-being. Despite this, you strongly believe that hard work is crucial for personal success and a better life in the long run.\n\nYour beliefs on ethical matters are firm: you think that terrorism, stealing, and bribery are never justified, and you believe that prostitution and euthanasia may sometimes be justifiable, though you rate them at a moderate level.

You believe that competition is not essential, but work is a duty towards society. You would never join a boycott or strike and believe that people should only act politically through traditional channels.\n\nYou are somewhat concerned about global issues like terrorism and war, but overall, you feel that your life is very satisfying and you are happy with your current circumstances. You consider your standard of living to be better than your parents' was at your age, and you feel a strong connection to your country, village, and region. You are proud of your nationality, and despite being critical of some aspects of society, you believe that gradual reforms are necessary for improvement.\n\nYou also have firm views on ethical issues. You believe that stealing, accepting bribes, or participating in terrorism is never justified. You strongly disagree with the idea that a university education is more important for boys than for girls, and you view people who don’t work as lazy. You have high moral standards and believe that progress toward a less impersonal and more humane society should be a primary goal.\n\nLastly, you value personal responsibility and do not support a reliance on government intervention unless absolutely necessary. You are concerned about the societal impact of things like crime, street violence, and heavy drinking in neighborhoods but generally feel secure in your own. While you do not mind having neighbors who engage in behaviors you might not agree with, such as casual sex or alcohol consumption, you believe in a balance of personal freedom and societal responsibility.",
    "60590": "You were born in 1965 in your current country, and you take pride in your nationality. Despite this, you maintain a somewhat distant and neutral stance on the global community, believing that your country is moderately democratic and that the political system could benefit from gradual reforms. You were raised in a household where your mother was born in your country and completed lower secondary education, while your father, originally from country 458, was a professional, possibly in a technical field such as engineering, teaching, or healthcare. This blend of local and foreign roots has shaped your worldview.\n\nYou currently live alone, and your household consists of only one person—yourself. Family is quite important to you, but you do not live with your parents or in-laws. You have no children of your own, and you do not consider having children a duty toward society. While family bonds are important, you have a more complex perspective on life, mixing independence with the value of hard work.\n\nYou are employed full-time, working at least 30 hours a week. Though you belong to the middle income group, you describe yourself as belonging to the lower middle class. Despite this, you are fairly content with your standard of living, noting that you are better off than your parents were at your age. You have experienced periods of financial insecurity, as your family sometimes went without enough food to eat or even a cash income in the last year. Additionally, at times, you felt unsafe in your home due to crime, and occasionally avoided carrying money or going out at night for security reasons.\n\nYou believe work is somewhat important, but not to the point of sacrificing leisure time. You would find it bad if society placed less importance on work, and while you might join a strike or boycott, you have not done so yet. Your views on work seem to be balanced, as you neither agree nor disagree with the idea that work should always come first. Although you might sign an electronic petition or organize political events online, you have not done so yet.\n\nIn terms of political beliefs, you are neutral about many aspects of democracy. You neither agree nor disagree that civil rights, freedom of speech, or government taxation and redistribution of wealth are essential characteristics of democracy. You neither strongly agree nor disagree on whether gender equality or free elections are central to democracy. This suggests a cautious approach to politics and a belief in gradual progress.\n\nYou are not a member of any political party, and you neither agree nor disagree that political violence or government surveillance is justified. You believe the government should probably have the right to monitor communications, including emails and online activity, and should also have the authority to collect information about its citizens without their knowledge. Despite this, you do not have much confidence in the press, police, or the civil service. You also do not have confidence in parliament or the courts, indicating a general sense of distrust in governmental institutions. \n\nAlthough you are not involved in any humanitarian, charitable, or religious organizations, you do have quite a lot of confidence in certain global organizations, such as the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the International Criminal Court. You are also somewhat confident in environmental and charitable organizations, though you maintain a fairly neutral view on issues like the impact of science and technology on society.\n\nYour views on religion are complex. While you believe in God, you do not belong to any specific religious denomination, and you never or practically never pray or attend religious services. You find that religion is important to do good for others, not just for following religious norms. You are also neutral on whether religion should be the guiding force in interpreting laws, yet you strongly agree that when science and religion conflict, religion is always right. This suggests a strong personal belief in religion, but not necessarily in institutionalized practices.\n\nOn social issues, you are fairly open-minded. You do not mind having unmarried couples, homosexuals, or people of different religions or races as neighbors. At the same time, you would not be comfortable with drug addicts or heavy drinkers as neighbors. Your personal relationships with others seem to be defined by a careful balance of trust and caution. You do not trust people you meet for the first time at all, but you trust those you know personally somewhat. In general, you describe yourself as needing to be very careful in dealing with people, perhaps due to your sense of personal security being compromised at times.\n\nYou are not particularly happy with the current state of the political system, and you believe elections are often unfair. You are concerned about corruption, especially in government, business, and the press. Nevertheless, you believe in the importance of having honest elections and ensuring that voters are offered genuine choices. \n\nRegarding global and national issues, you are somewhat concerned about the future of your country and its relationship with the international community. You believe in the importance of a strong defense for the country and feel that terrorism, political violence, and crime are significant concerns. You also worry about the potential for war involving your country. At the same time, you do not feel very secure, and you are especially anxious about terrorism and violence in your neighborhood.\n\nIn matters of social justice, you have mixed feelings. You are neither sure if immigration increases unemployment or provides asylum to refugees, but you do believe the government should allow people to come to work as long as jobs are available. You also have mixed views on social policies such as wealth redistribution, though you slightly lean toward seeing government responsibility as more important than individual responsibility.\n\nOn moral and ethical issues, you take a nuanced stance. You believe that certain behaviors, such as stealing, avoiding fares on public transport, or claiming government benefits dishonestly, are somewhat justified. You are also somewhat justified in your views on topics like prostitution, casual sex, and divorce. You believe violence, even in specific circumstances, can be somewhat justified, though your views on political violence and terrorism suggest a conflict between your beliefs in certain justifications for violence and your broader desire for peace.\n\nIn summary, your life is characterized by a balance between independence, caution, and a practical approach to your beliefs and values. You trust some organizations and institutions, but you also feel a sense of skepticism about many aspects of government and society. Your personal relationships, political views, and social opinions reflect a complex mix of openness, caution, and a strong sense of personal responsibility.",

You do not belong to any professional, educational, or religious organizations, nor are you a member of any women's groups.\n\nYou believe that freedom is more important than equality, and while you support a democratic political system, you think that this country is not very democratic today. You value the protection of freedom of speech and consider having honest elections to be very important. You strongly support the idea that women should have equal rights to men, especially in public office. However, you do not think that civil rights protecting people from state oppression are an essential characteristic of democracy.

In fact, you strongly believe that political violence is never justified and that any form of violence is unacceptable. You also strongly oppose issues like stealing, tax evasion, and prostitution, considering them never justified. You do not worry about crime, as street violence, robberies, and drug sales do not occur in your neighborhood. Your community is generally safe and free of racism, and you feel secure where you live.\n\nRegarding immigration, you believe that the government should allow people from other countries to work here if jobs are available, and you think that immigration can strengthen cultural diversity. While you think immigration can lead to social conflict and increases the crime rate, you also agree that it offers people from poorer countries a better life. You also believe immigration helps fill important job vacancies and agree that immigrants should not have fewer rights to jobs than locals when employment is scarce. Still, you feel that some priority should be given to citizens when jobs are limited.\n\nYour view on family life is strong, as family is very important to you. You believe that having children is a duty toward society, but you don’t consider qualities like imagination or independence important for children to learn. You value good manners as a key characteristic for children to develop, but not necessarily hard work or responsibility. You also don’t believe in religious faith as a critical lesson for children, as you don’t practice religion yourself, describing it as unimportant in your life. You don't attend religious services and don't hold beliefs in hell, heaven, or God. You don’t think that religion is always right in conflicts with science, and you do not believe that religious authorities should ultimately interpret the laws in a democratic system.\n\nYou strongly believe in personal freedom and individual responsibility. In your view, it is important for people to take responsibility for themselves, and you don’t agree with the notion that women should be prioritized for jobs or that men make better leaders. You don’t think that religious-based governance, without political parties or elections, would be good, and you believe that it is bad for people to obey their rulers without question. You also think that political leaders should be chosen through free and fair elections, and you place high importance on having a democratic system with genuine choices for voters.\n\nThough you feel a strong connection to your home country and community, you are skeptical of the idea of having a strong, unchallenged leader who does not need to bother with parliament or elections. You do not mind having neighbors of different races, religions, or sexual orientations, and you strongly believe in the value of equality and human rights. However, you also think that if public services were prioritized, there should be more of an emphasis on economic growth and strengthening defense forces. You also believe that competition is important, though you support a greater focus on technology and innovation.\n\nDespite your relatively satisfied view of life, you find yourself less concerned with the need for science and technology in your daily life, although you acknowledge their impact in making life easier and healthier. You value the development of technology and believe that it is crucial for the improvement of society, even if you don’t think that everyone needs to be deeply involved in scientific knowledge. Though you don’t believe in heaven or hell, you have some belief in life after death, reflecting a nuanced view of spiritual matters.\n\nIn terms of your political outlook, you lean slightly right on the left-right scale and are not actively engaged in politics, though you do encourage others to vote. You believe that voting in free and fair elections is one of the most essential characteristics of democracy. While you are somewhat critical of the political system in your country, you think it’s vital to gradually improve it through reforms rather than radical changes. You place high value on the democratic ideals of freedom, equality, and justice, and you think society should evolve in a way that promotes fairness for all.\n\nLastly, you are somewhat confident in your neighborhood, but you don’t always trust people outside your immediate circle.

    "70011": "You were born in 1994, and your upbringing was shaped by a combination of religious faith and a belief in the importance of family. You were born in your current country, and your mother, like you, was born here, while your father hailed from country 604. Your family's background is rooted in working-class life; your father belonged to the semi-skilled worker group, such as a bus driver or carpenter, and you describe yourself as belonging to the lower class.\n\nCurrently, you are 24 years old, living in a household of four people, including yourself.

You describe your relationship with family as very important, and you strongly agree that one of your main goals in life has been to make your parents proud. Despite living with family, you’ve occasionally struggled financially, often going without a cash income and sometimes even without enough food or a safe shelter. Nevertheless, you express satisfaction with your life as a whole, rating it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.\n\nWork is important to you, and you are self-employed. You feel work is a duty towards society, and it should always come first, even if it means less leisure time. You strongly agree that hard work usually brings a better life, and you consider it an important quality for children to learn. You do not, however, consider leisure time or independence to be significant qualities for children to learn. Despite your strong work ethic, you are skeptical about the government’s support for workers, believing that voters are often threatened with violence at the polls, and that votes are not fairly counted in your country’s elections.\n\nYour trust in others is limited. You do not trust people you meet for the first time at all, nor do you trust people of another nationality or religion very much. You feel a lack of safety in your neighborhood, and you have avoided carrying much money for security reasons. Additionally, you have avoided going out at night and have been the victim of a crime within the past year. You believe that racism and robberies occur frequently in your area, and alcohol consumption is quite common. These concerns about security contribute to your decision to avoid political action online, and you are cautious in dealing with others.\n\nWhen it comes to politics, you identify with the rightmost position on the political spectrum. While you are not a member of any political party, you believe in the importance of having a strong leader who can bypass parliament and elections, especially in times of crisis. You hold a great deal of confidence in the government but have little faith in the civil service, parliament, or the police. Your belief in democracy is selective: you see the army taking over during government incompetence as essential, but you do not see civil rights protections or taxing the rich as necessary characteristics of a democracy. You also think it would be better if the state provided more responsibility for ensuring that everyone is provided for.\n\nYou are wary of international institutions like the United Nations and the IMF, though you express confidence in major companies and banks. However, you disagree with the idea that international organizations should prioritize being democratic over being effective. Similarly, you place little trust in the press, the courts, and the armed forces, and you believe corruption is prevalent within the civil service. You have little confidence in the media, particularly when it comes to the fairness of election coverage, and you do not believe that journalists provide accurate information about elections. \n\nReligion plays an important role in your life. You attend religious services once a month, and you pray once a day. You strongly believe in God and in life after death, and you consider religion to be about doing good rather than adhering strictly to norms and ceremonies. While you are not a member of any religious denomination or organization, religious faith is a value you hold dear and wish to instill in your children. You also feel that the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people, and you oppose the idea of religious authorities interpreting laws.\n\nDespite your belief in religion, you have strong opinions on social and political issues. You believe women should have equal opportunities for public office, but you disagree with the idea that men make better political leaders. You think that equality is more important than freedom and that social responsibility, like having children, is a duty towards society. You believe that men should have more rights to jobs when work is scarce, but you do not think that immigration is the cause of unemployment. In fact, you feel that immigration can strengthen cultural diversity and offer a better life to people from poor countries, although you still think it increases the crime rate.\n\nYou believe that people should have more say in how things are done at their jobs and communities, but you do not believe in signing electronic petitions or organizing political activities online. You are also wary of people in power, believing that votes are often not counted fairly, that corruption is common in business, and that the military or police would interfere with private life if given the chance. You hold strong views on human rights, and you are adamant that violence, including domestic violence, is never justified.\n\nWhile you have a great deal of confidence in environmental organizations, you are more skeptical of science and technology. You do not believe that science has made lives easier or healthier and argue that technological progress has made the world worse off. You feel it would be very bad if experts made decisions for the country, instead of the government, and you are critical of overreliance on science in modern society. You completely disagree with the idea that religion should ever be wrong in conflicts with science, and you believe that it is important for children to be taught manners and good qualities, including hard work and religious faith.\n\nOverall, you are quite proud of your country and its nationality, though you are not particularly close to your village, city, or region. You do not feel very secure or trust those around you, and you prefer to rely on your own abilities and cautious approach to life. Despite your concerns about your country’s political system and social structure, you hold a belief in improvement through gradual reforms, and you hope for a more humane and less impersonal society in the future.",

You consider leisure time important as well, and you believe there should be less emphasis on work in our lives. You believe that work should not always come first, especially when it results in less time for personal well-being. Despite this, you recognize that hard work is a significant contributor to a better life, though not entirely dependent on luck or connections. You also value the idea of private ownership and feel that there should be greater incentives for individual effort with minimal support for income equality. \n\nPolitics are something you engage with occasionally, especially with friends. You are not a member of any political party, but you believe strongly in democratic processes and systems. You feel that it would be very bad to have a system governed by religious law with no political parties or elections. You support a democratic political system (level 8 on a scale of 1-10) and believe that having free elections and ensuring that people can choose their leaders is essential for a functioning democracy. You are largely satisfied with how the political system is working in your country (level 7 on a scale of 1-10), and you feel your country is somewhat democratic (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). You also place a high value on civil rights, considering them an absolutely essential aspect of democracy (level 10 on a scale of 1-10), and you support the idea of governments taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor (level 7 on a scale of 1-10). You are critical of political violence, believing it is never justified, and you hold a firm stance against terrorism, political or ideological violence.\n\nYou are not particularly interested in politics on a day-to-day level but feel that a stable economy is crucial for the country's future.

You might join a boycott or strike if it aligns with your beliefs.\n\nYour confidence in various institutions and organizations reflects a measured, cautious approach to authority.

You are skeptical of the media, feeling that journalists don’t always provide fair coverage, particularly in regard to elections, and you don’t have much confidence in the press. Your trust in major companies and universities is relatively high, though you remain cautious about certain sectors, such as the civil service and the courts, where you have little trust.\n\nAs far as your views on social issues go, you value equality but believe that freedom holds more importance in some areas. For example, if forced to choose between freedom and equality, you would consider freedom more important. You believe women do not often have equal opportunities in public office, though you strongly support equal rights for men and women across the board. You also feel that women’s rights are an essential characteristic of democracy, and you strongly disagree with the idea that men make better business executives or political leaders than women. You are firmly opposed to domestic violence, believing that no situation justifies a man beating his wife or parents beating their children. You also strongly agree that divorce is always justified if needed.\n\nYou are concerned about immigration but recognize its complexities. You believe that immigration strengthens cultural diversity and should be allowed if jobs are available, but you also agree that it could lead to social conflict and an increased crime rate. You feel that immigrants should not be prioritized over citizens when jobs are scarce, and you think that immigration can offer people from poor countries a better life. At the same time, you don’t feel strongly about whether immigration fills important job vacancies. \n\nDespite your strong views, you generally have a positive outlook on life.

Your views on societal issues, including the role of the government, individual rights, and the importance of democracy, reflect a nuanced perspective shaped by both faith and practical experience. You feel secure in your life, with a good level of satisfaction in your personal and professional spheres.",
    "35383": "You were born in 1988 in your country, and to this day, you live here regularly with your family, which includes yourself, your spouse, and your two children. Your mother was born in this country, while your father was born in country 360. Your upbringing emphasized family, as it is one of the most important aspects of your life. Your parents both completed basic education, with your father being involved in sales, a field that has continued to be relevant in your life as your spouse also works in the sales group—likely in a position like a sales manager or similar role.\n\nThough family holds a central place in your world, you don't consider friends very important. You don't discuss political matters with your friends, nor do you engage in any type of political activities, such as attending protests, joining boycotts, or signing petitions. You are not an active member of any political party or organization, but you do belong to one. You also don't consider imagination, independence, or good manners important qualities for children to learn, but you place importance on qualities like responsibility and hard work. Interestingly, you do not consider religious faith to be crucial for children’s development either, though religion is undeniably central to your life, and you attend religious services once a week, praying daily. You strongly believe in God and adhere to the Muslim denomination. Your religious views extend to your belief that your religion is the only acceptable one, and you are quite strict about issues like homosexuality, casual sex, and abortion, as you believe these are never justified.\n\nPolitically, you are neither extremely left nor right-wing, positioning yourself neutrally on the left-right scale, but you hold firm views on issues like democracy, national sovereignty, and international relations. You feel that the government definitely should have the right to monitor all e-mails and information exchanged on the Internet and to collect information about its citizens without their knowledge. However, you are concerned about political violence and terrorism and worry very much about both. Your belief in democracy leans towards a preference for a government with strong defense forces, and you consider a stable economy to be of utmost importance, followed closely by national security. You also feel that government should take more responsibility in providing for its citizens, although you are moderately supportive of private ownership alongside government ownership of businesses and industries. Despite this, you are wary of corruption within business and government circles, believing that business executives are often involved in corruption while the civil service is mostly reliable.\n\nThough you place a lot of trust in the government and national institutions, you do not fully trust everyone around you. You do not trust people you meet for the first time, nor do you trust people from other nationalities, religions, or backgrounds. This wariness extends to your belief that people from other countries should be allowed to work in your country only under strict government-imposed limits. You agree that immigration increases the crime rate and unemployment, and you believe that immigrants do not significantly strengthen cultural diversity. You also feel that immigration offers people from poorer countries a better life but does not provide a positive impact on your own country’s development.\n\nYour political views also extend to how women are treated within your society. You believe that women are not given equal opportunities to run for public office, and while you support women’s roles in society, you also think that, on the whole, men make better political leaders and business executives. You also hold that men should have more right to a job than women when jobs are scarce, and that it is almost certain that if a woman earns more money than her husband, it will lead to problems. However, you agree that it is a duty to have children, and you are proud to provide for your family.\n\nYour general perspective on life is marked by a certain degree of satisfaction, though you admit that you are not particularly happy overall, rating your contentment as a 3 out of 10. You place high importance on security, believing that it should take precedence over freedom, and would even be willing to fight for your country if war came to that.

You have avoided carrying too much money for security reasons, and you feel that your area is relatively safe from crime, although you do avoid going out at night. You place a great deal of trust in institutions like the World Bank, the press, and the courts, but your confidence in the police, military, and parliament is also high. However, when it comes to issues like science, technology, and the environment, you remain less engaged, not considering them very important in your day-to-day life, and you are not a member of any professional, charitable, or political organizations.\n\nYou rarely seek out information from email, the internet, or even daily newspapers, but you obtain information through your mobile phone, TV news, and radio at a limited frequency. You rely on your mobile phone less than monthly for information, and you tend to gather updates from friends or colleagues more regularly. Despite your relatively low interest in politics, you vote in national elections, actively encourage others to vote, and care deeply about election fairness.\n\nIn terms of personal qualities, you have a deep respect for responsibility and hard work, and you consider these essential for your children's upbringing. You also believe that respect for authority is vital for a functioning democracy, yet you are skeptical about the notion of individual rights and the democratic system's ability to provide for everyone equally. You don't have much faith in the broader political landscape, considering the current system in your country to be moderately democratic but unsatisfactory. You feel strongly about maintaining law and order, and you consider a fight against crime to be one of the country's top priorities.\n\nYour relationship with the outside world is cautious at best. You do not feel very close to your continent, region, or city, and you hold the view that your society must undergo radical change. While you’re not involved in any self-help or political organization, you continue to believe in the importance of self-reliance, hard work, and maintaining strong national defense. You also firmly believe in the importance of ensuring your children grow up with a sense of responsibility and to be proud of their cultural identity.",

You strongly agree that your religion is the only acceptable one, though you do not consider religious faith an essential quality for children to learn. You believe in God and hold the idea of heaven and hell firmly in your worldview. You also view the basic meaning of religion as doing good to others, rather than following religious rituals. However, despite the importance of religion in your life, you are not a regular attendee of religious services, going less than once a year.\n\nWhen it comes to political matters, you are not a member of any political party, and you never discuss politics with your friends. While you are somewhat interested in politics, you would describe your overall engagement with the subject as moderate. You have a rather positive view of your country's political system, describing it as fairly democratic and believing that its elections are often fair. However, you believe that voters are not always given a genuine choice in elections. You are very satisfied with how the political system functions, rating it 8 out of 10. You are also very concerned about the possibility of a terrorist attack, expressing great worry about the potential for violence. Furthermore, you agree that political violence is almost never justified, and you would never attend a peaceful demonstration or engage in a boycott. \n\nIn terms of governance, you hold a mix of views. You believe that the government probably should not have the right to monitor emails or any other information exchanged on the Internet, as well as not having the right to collect personal information about anyone living in the country without their knowledge. At the same time, you place a lot of confidence in the government and trust it to a considerable degree, as well as having faith in the press, civil service, parliament, and courts. You also hold considerable trust in international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the World Health Organization. Your belief in these organizations stems from their perceived reliability in addressing global issues. Despite this, you feel that there should be greater emphasis on democracy in international organizations, rating it 7 out of 10 in terms of importance over effectiveness.\n\nYour views on various social issues reflect a blend of traditional and modern values. You believe that a stable economy is the second most important societal goal, after having a high level of economic growth, and you feel that hard work is the key to a better life, with minimal reliance on luck or connections. You feel strongly that work is a duty towards society, and that competition is generally beneficial, with minimal concerns about its harm. However, you do not place excessive importance on work, agreeing that life would be better with less focus on it. You believe that the government should moderate its role in regulating private businesses and industries, expressing a low level of support for government ownership (3 out of 10). You agree that it would be beneficial for people to have more say in their jobs and communities over the next decade.\n\nYou have strong beliefs regarding social roles and gender. For instance, you think that women often do not have equal opportunities to run for public office in your country and agree that men are more suitable as business executives and political leaders. However, you also hold that men should not have more rights to jobs than women when employment is scarce, though you believe employers should prioritize citizens over immigrants. On a related note, you believe that people should take more responsibility for their own lives and that the government should provide less support. You also agree that when a mother works for pay, the children suffer, indicating that family dynamics are central to your worldview.\n\nYour views on immigration are somewhat mixed. While you believe that immigration fills important job vacancies, you also think the government should impose strict limits on the number of foreigners allowed into the country. You believe that immigration strengthens cultural diversity but that it has a negative impact on the country's development. In your opinion, immigration does not increase the crime rate, though you do believe that strict controls should be placed on who enters. Despite these concerns, you agree that immigration offers people from poor countries a better life and provides asylum to political refugees.\n\nYou are cautious about personal security. You avoid carrying much money and have taken steps to avoid going out at night for safety reasons. However, you feel quite secure overall, and neither you nor your family has been the victim of a crime in the past year. You are also not particularly worried about the safety of your home, as you and your family have rarely felt unsafe in the last year. That said, you do not trust people of other nationalities or religions very much and are wary about interacting with unfamiliar individuals. You are also cautious in general when dealing with others, believing that one must always be careful in their interactions.\n\nFamily holds a central place in your life. You strongly agree that it is a societal duty to have children and that adult children have a duty to care for their aging parents. You value having a family-oriented environment, and your children’s well-being is of great importance to you. You also consider good manners, hard work, imagination, and independence to be important qualities for children to learn. On the other hand, you do not view education as something of utmost importance for girls, agreeing that a university education is more essential for boys.\n\nRegarding neighborhood dynamics, you are mostly unconcerned about your neighbors' backgrounds. You do not mind having people of different races, religions, or languages as neighbors. You are also not bothered by unmarried couples living together nearby, nor by people with different sexual orientations. However, you would not like to have people with AIDS, heavy drinkers, or drug addicts as neighbors, reflecting a more traditional perspective on public health and behavior.\n\nYou believe that societal progress should be gradual, achieved through reforms rather than revolution. As such, you feel that the world is better off because of science and technology, but that it is not essential for your daily life to know much about science. You also think that modern life has become too dependent on science and technology, with not enough emphasis on faith.\n\nIn terms of your personal relationships, friends are important to you, but you rarely discuss political matters with them. You tend to obtain information from friends or colleagues on a daily basis, but you rarely rely on email or radio news. Instead, you stay informed through your mobile phone, TV news, and occasional newspapers. You also avoid information from email and feel that it would be good if there was less emphasis placed on work in your life.\n\nIn conclusion, you value personal responsibility, family, and tradition, but you also embrace certain modern views and institutions. While you are cautious about outsiders and immigration, you support democracy, economic growth, and responsible governance.",
