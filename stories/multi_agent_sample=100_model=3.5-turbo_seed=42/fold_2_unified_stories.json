Religion is central to your life, and you belong to the Muslim denomination. You attend religious services weekly and pray several times a day. You consider God to be of utmost importance, and your belief in God is unshakable, with the basic meaning of religion for you being to follow religious norms and ceremonies rather than to do good for others.

While you are cautious about the extent of government surveillance, you also feel strongly that privacy and freedom should be defended.\n\nIn terms of economic issues, you strongly believe that economic growth should be the country's most important goal over the next decade, even if it means some environmental costs. You think a stable economy is most important and that fighting rising prices should be the country’s priority.

Your opinion is that the country's government should focus on fostering economic growth and creating jobs, even at the expense of some environmental issues.\n\nWhile you generally trust people you know personally completely, you are cautious with others and believe it’s important to be very careful in dealing with people. Your trust in the press, major organizations, and some global institutions like the United Nations, IMF, and World Health Organization is limited.

There is little crime or violence in your area, and your neighborhood is mostly free from racist behavior, drug sales, or street violence.\n\nDespite your strong religious views, you have a relatively progressive stance on certain social issues. You do not mind having unmarried couples living together as neighbors, and you do not mind having people of a different race, nationality, or religion living nearby. However, you are less accepting of homosexuality, considering it almost never justified. You are not worried about terrorism or civil war, nor are you particularly concerned about the threat of a terrorist attack.\n\nWhen it comes to the role of women in society, you believe women have equal opportunities to run for public office and that women should have the same rights as men. You disagree with the idea that a woman earning more than her husband would cause problems in a marriage. However, you feel that when a mother works for pay, the children suffer to some extent, a reflection of your more traditional views on family roles.\n\nAlthough you do not trust many larger institutions, you do believe in the importance of education and have confidence in universities, although you do not have much faith in environmental organizations or women's groups. You believe that learning about science is not crucial for daily life but acknowledge the role of science and technology in providing more opportunities for the next generation. \n\nYou are somewhat satisfied with your life overall, rating your happiness as an 8 out of 10. You have a fair amount of confidence in various national institutions, including the armed forces and courts, and you would be willing to fight for your country if it came to that. Although you find it important to follow moral rules, you believe that it is often hard to decide which ones are the right ones to follow. You see a moderate level of corruption in your country, but you still feel that your life choices are largely under your control.\n\nYour views on social issues are shaped by a mix of conservatism and respect for individual freedom. You believe that stealing is never justified, and you strongly oppose bribery and corruption. You also disagree with justifying abortion or the death penalty in any circumstance, aligning with your more conservative views on moral issues. You would consider boycotting products or supporting electronic petitions for causes you believe in, but you have not yet acted on these intentions. You are cautious about political activism and would never organize political activities online.",

You believe that people should be able to move freely if there are jobs available, and that immigrants fill important job vacancies. You are not worried about immigration leading to rising unemployment, but you do not think that immigration necessarily offers a better life to people from poor countries.

You value both freedom and security but lean towards security in a conflict between the two. You do not mind if people in your neighborhood have habits like drinking heavily or smoking, and you don’t mind if your neighbors are people from different backgrounds, races, or religions.

    "97081": "You were born in country 716, where you have spent most of your life. Your family, including your parents, has had a profound influence on your values and worldview. Your mother, who was born in the same country, did not have formal education or only received early childhood education. On the other hand, your father was born in country 716 and belonged to the semi-skilled worker group, with a limited formal education. Despite these modest beginnings, both of them instilled in you a deep sense of responsibility and a strong work ethic. You also hold religion in high regard, with God being a central part of your life. You pray several times a day and attend religious services more than once a week. \n\nAlthough you grew up in a household where material needs were sometimes a struggle, with your family occasionally going without enough food or medicine in the past 12 months, they did their best to provide for you. These experiences shaped your perspective on life, making you particularly concerned about economic security. You are the chief wage earner in your household, which consists of five people, including yourself, and you have four children. You were raised to value the importance of family, and family remains a central pillar in your life.\n\nYour spouse is a full-time employee, with a Bachelor's degree or equivalent, and belongs to the professional and technical group, much like yourself. You both value hard work and commitment, with your spouse working 30 or more hours a week. You trust your spouse and believe deeply in the importance of family support. You do not live with your parents or in-laws, which gives you a certain sense of independence and control over your own life.\n\nIn terms of political beliefs, you are quite engaged, although you are not a member of any active political party. You feel that politics is extremely important and that a democratic political system is the best way to govern your country. You are dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country today, and you believe that the government should not have the right to monitor e-mails, personal information, or engage in video surveillance in public spaces. You are concerned about corruption within local and state authorities and strongly believe that many of the state authorities, as well as most of the local authorities, are involved in corruption. You have little to no confidence in political parties and the fairness of elections, which is further compounded by the fact that you believe most votes are not counted fairly, and that election officials are often not impartial. \n\nOn the issue of religion and democracy, you are a strong proponent of the separation between religion and political governance. You firmly believe that having a system governed by religious law with no political parties or elections would be disastrous for your country. You also reject the idea of religious authorities interpreting laws, seeing this as incompatible with democratic values. You hold that democracy is essential for a fair society, and you firmly believe that people choosing their leaders in free elections is an absolutely essential characteristic of democracy.\n\nYou hold strong beliefs about equality, freedom, and fairness. While you are not very proud of your country’s nationality, you consider individual freedom to be of paramount importance.

You believe that social equality should take precedence over freedom, and you consider women's equal rights and opportunities in public office to be an essential aspect of democracy.

However, you remain concerned about the broader state of society. You worry that society has little respect for individual human rights, and that voters are frequently threatened with violence or bribed during elections. These concerns have made you more hesitant about placing trust in institutions, and you find that you have limited confidence in the media, police, and armed forces. Still, you have quite a lot of confidence in charitable organizations, humanitarian groups, and major companies.\n\nYou believe in a stable economy as the foundation for a prosperous country, and while you consider the basic meaning of religion to be doing good for others rather than following norms and ceremonies, you hold that there are broader moral complexities at play in society. You often find yourself navigating a delicate balance between your religious beliefs, political views, and the pragmatic needs of your family and society. Despite your concerns about politics, you feel a sense of duty to engage in political matters and even might sign a petition or participate in a boycott if the situation called for it. However, you do not believe political violence is ever justified, and you hold that peaceful, lawful methods of advocacy are the right course of action.\n\nYou value leisure time and believe that having time for relaxation is important. However, you also feel that work should come first, even at the expense of spare time. You also think that the country should focus on creating jobs and economic growth, even if it means sacrificing some environmental considerations. \n\nYour views on social issues like divorce, abortion, and prostitution are conservative.

In terms of social issues, you believe that immigration increases unemployment, social conflict, and terrorism risks. You are particularly concerned about immigration filling important job vacancies, but you also disagree with the idea that immigration provides asylum to political refugees. You are strongly against the idea of immigrants or foreign workers coming to your country.\n\nYou trust your family completely and believe that having honest elections is critical. You also feel that voters in this country are offered a fair choice in elections and that votes are counted fairly. However, you have concerns about corruption in elections, believing that rich people can buy them, and that bribery often occurs. You believe that there is substantial corruption within both state and local authorities. You trust your friends, but you do not engage with them about political matters. Similarly, you do not discuss political issues with others or take part in demonstrations.\n\nThough you have little confidence in labor unions or consumer organizations, you do have a great deal of confidence in charitable and humanitarian organizations. You are also confident in women's organizations and environmental organizations. However, you are not a member of any of these groups. You do not engage in social media or any internet-based activities to gather information. Your trust in the press and universities is fairly strong, although you feel that the TV news often favors the governing party.\n\nYou place high importance on having children, believing that it is a societal duty to raise them, although you worry about not being able to provide them with good education. Despite some concerns about your financial situation, you are mostly satisfied with the financial state of your household (level 8 on a scale of 1-10), and you have not been without cash income or shelter in the past year. You would never sign a petition or encourage others to act on political issues, nor would you join a boycott or a campaign. You would also never contact a government official or attend a peaceful demonstration.\n\nIn your view, protecting freedom of speech ranks as the second most important value for your country, while a high level of economic growth is the country’s most critical goal for the next ten years. You are not particularly concerned about losing your job or finding new work but are worried about the risks posed by a potential war or civil war. You feel insecure in your daily life, particularly in terms of your neighborhood, where you believe police or military interference with private life happens frequently. You also believe that drug sales are common in your area, though street violence is not.\n\nYou do not like to have certain types of neighbors, including those who are heavy drinkers, drug addicts, or people with AIDS. You also do not mind having neighbors who speak a different language or who belong to a different religion. However, you would not be comfortable with neighbors of a different race or nationality. You are not concerned about your children being raised in a home where both parents work, and you feel that a woman's earning more than her husband would likely cause problems in the family.\n\nIn terms of your neighborhood's social dynamics, you do not feel very close to it, and you do not trust the people living around you. While you generally believe that there is little corruption in your neighborhood, you do not feel the same way about the government. You also moderately agree that moral rules are difficult to follow in today's society, and you feel that many of the social norms are difficult to navigate. Despite these struggles, you consider tolerance and respect for others important qualities for children to learn.",
    "55303": "You were born in country 484, where you still reside today. You feel quite close to your country, town, and region, and take pride in your nationality. Religion holds a significant place in your life, as you belong to the Roman Catholic denomination and attend religious services once a month. You believe in God, and while religion is somewhat important to you, you feel its primary purpose is to help make sense of life in the present world rather than focusing solely on life after death. You also strongly agree that when science and religion conflict, religion is always right.\n\nYour family background includes a rich educational history. Your father, born in country 484, holds a Bachelor's degree, and your mother, also born in this country, shares the same level of education. Despite your family's strong academic foundation, you do not hold much confidence in universities, the press, or major global organizations like the IMF, UN, or World Bank. These organizations have earned very little trust from you. Your opinion of political parties is also lukewarm, and while you are a member of one, you are not particularly active in it.\n\nPolitically, you hold views that lean toward skepticism regarding democratic systems and international cooperation. You feel that democracy is not the ideal system for your country, and that political violence is never justified. You believe that, in general, politicians should not be trusted, and you have very little faith in elections and the fairness of vote counting in your country. Furthermore, you are skeptical of the role international bodies like NATO and the United Nations play on the world stage.\n\nYou are not one to support the status quo in governance, and would rather see experts make decisions rather than elected officials. You feel the government should have the right to surveil its citizens in public spaces, and you also agree that the government should collect information about its people without their knowledge. At the same time, you are concerned about issues like rising prices, economic growth, and job creation, which you believe should be the country's top priorities, even at the expense of the environment.\n\nSocial issues are also close to your heart. You believe that women should have equal opportunities for running for public office, and you strongly support the idea that homosexual couples can be just as good parents as other couples. However, you do not consider women's rights to be an essential characteristic of democracy, nor do you believe in the universal equality of the sexes when it comes to leadership roles. You think men often make better political leaders than women, and you find it hard to say whether a university education is more important for a boy than a girl.\n\nYour household consists of two members, yourself and your spouse, who belongs to the professional and technical group. You are both highly educated, with your spouse holding a Bachelor's degree as well. However, your family has faced economic struggles in recent years, sometimes going without enough food or medicine. You have also gone without a safe shelter at times, which contributes to your ongoing concerns about financial security and access to healthcare.\n\nYou are somewhat satisfied with your life overall, rating your happiness at a 7 on a scale of 1-10. Still, you feel somewhat insecure and unsure about the future. You worry a lot about not being able to provide your children with a good education, as you value education highly for them. Despite these challenges, you still consider family to be very important in your life.\n\nYour political views align with a desire for stability and economic prosperity. You strongly believe in the importance of hard work and competition but recognize the harmful effects of excessive competition. You support economic growth and job creation as essential goals for your country. However, you feel that your society must gradually improve through reforms, and you find it hard to support major political demonstrations or actions.\n\nIn terms of community, you trust your family completely but feel more cautious about others. You do not trust people of another religion or nationality, nor do you trust people you know in general. You are not inclined to get involved in political actions online or support boycotts. Instead, you prioritize security over freedom and consider it more important to ensure safety in your country.\n\nYour views on immigration are more complex. While you believe immigration leads to social conflict and might increase unemployment, you do think that the government should allow anyone to come and work. You are unsure about the role immigration plays in filling job vacancies or providing a better life for people from poor countries, but you do not mind having immigrants or foreign workers as neighbors.\n\nYour household values good manners and respect for others. You believe children should learn qualities like obedience, respect, and tolerance, though you do not see thrift or unselfishness as essential qualities. Your personal life and family upbringing have shaped your strong belief in the importance of security, financial stability, and family life, even if it means sacrificing political or social activism. \n\nDespite your misgivings about the current political system and lack of faith in its ability to function properly, you do vote regularly in national elections. However, you do not believe that voting is always a genuine choice or that the elections are fair. You also feel that corruption is widespread in your country, and that voters are sometimes bribed. \n\nIn summary, you value stability, family, and security, holding a mixture of traditional and practical views about religion, governance, and society. You remain skeptical of political systems, global organizations, and the fairness of elections. Despite these concerns, you focus on the well-being of your family, your community, and the broader world, maintaining an outlook of cautious pragmatism.",
    "3906": "You were born in country 36, a place you are deeply proud to call home. Your father was also born in this country, and you are from a working-class background, with your father belonging to the semi-skilled worker group. You are a male, currently divorced, and you live in a household of one, with no immediate family members living with you. Despite not being satisfied with your financial situation (rating it a 2 out of 10), you feel that your life overall is moderately happy (7 out of 10) and that you still have a considerable amount of control over how things turn out (7 out of 10). \n\nFamily plays a crucial role in your life, and your two children are important to you. You strongly agree that one of your main goals in life has been to make your parents proud. You believe in the responsibility of adult children to provide long-term care for their parents. Despite not being religious, you hold strong values and consider certain qualities like good manners, determination, and perseverance important for children to learn. You also value tolerance, respect, and hard work, yet you don't consider unselfishness or obedience as necessary qualities for children. \n\nYou place a high value on friends, considering them very important to your life. Politics, however, is a significant aspect of your world too, though you are not a member of any political party. You occasionally discuss political matters with friends and even consider encouraging others to vote or take political action. Despite your interest in politics, you are dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country (1 out of 10) and have no confidence in political parties, the courts, the press, or even the elections in your country. You do believe, however, that free elections, with people choosing their leaders, is absolutely essential to democracy. You also have a rather low opinion of many of the international organizations, expressing no confidence in the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.\n\nOn the subject of government, you strongly believe that democracy is vital, but you lean towards favoring experts, rather than the government, to make decisions about the country. You believe the government should have the right to monitor emails and other information exchanged on the Internet, but when it comes to surveillance in public areas, you also believe it should be a government right. That said, you are not in favor of a government that collects information about its citizens without their knowledge. As for military or police interference, this has not been a concern in your neighborhood, but you do have some confidence in both the armed forces and the police. You don’t mind if there is more emphasis on the development of technology, but you also believe that protecting the environment should take precedence, even if it affects economic growth.\n\nYou trust your family completely, but when it comes to others, you are more cautious. You are not very trusting of people from other nationalities or religions, believing that immigration could lead to social conflict and an increase in terrorism risks. You feel that there should be strict limits on the number of foreigners allowed to work in your country, but you don't mind having people of different races, languages, or religions as neighbors. However, you would not like to have drug addicts, heavy drinkers, or people with AIDS living next to you.\n\nWhile you do not mind having unmarried couples as neighbors, you feel that certain issues like abortion, divorce, and women’s rights are important in shaping society. You believe that women should have equal opportunities to run for public office, and that women having the same rights as men is crucial to a democracy. You also support the idea of having women in positions of power and disagree that men are better political leaders. You believe that abortion is sometimes justified (7 out of 10) and divorce is often justified (8 out of 10). \n\nYou tend to avoid religious beliefs, not finding religion a central part of your life. You are not a member of any religious or church organization, rarely pray, and do not believe in hell, heaven, or life after death. You believe the basic meaning of religion is to do good for others, not to follow norms or ceremonies. You also feel that tolerance and respect for others should be instilled in children, but religious faith is not something that needs to be passed down.\n\nYour trust in institutions, particularly the press and government, is minimal. You do not have much confidence in the media, believing that TV news doesn’t favor the governing party and that journalists usually offer fair coverage of elections. However, you are deeply concerned about corruption, both at local and national levels, believing that there is substantial corruption in your country (8 out of 10). You also think that the government should tax the rich and subsidize the poor to uphold democracy. \n\nYou are moderately satisfied with your life these days but still find yourself worried about some things, like losing your job (which is your main worry) or not being able to provide a good education for your children. Your financial situation is difficult, and though you haven’t gone without enough food, shelter, or medical treatment recently, you do sometimes experience income instability. In terms of your work, you are the chief wage earner in your household, working in a private business or industry, and belong to the skilled worker group.\n\nAs for global issues, you are concerned about terrorism, war, and rising prices. However, you don’t believe political violence is ever justified, and you’re not worried about a civil war breaking out. You do believe it is a duty to defend your country if necessary and would be willing to fight if a war were to occur. You are also somewhat interested in peaceful demonstrations and may even join a boycott or sign an electronic petition in the future.\n\nYou have no confidence in the banks, major companies, or the courts, and you are not part of any professional, environmental, or recreational organizations. You do have confidence in charitable or humanitarian organizations, environmental groups, and women’s organizations, but your faith in banks, financial institutions, and major corporations is virtually nonexistent. \n\nIn matters of social norms and values, you hold strong opinions about freedom and equality. If you had to choose between the two, you would prioritize freedom. You also believe that society must gradually improve through reforms, and that the state should play a significant role in ensuring the protection of individual rights. You are not keen on a society governed by religious law, a system without elections or political parties, or a strong leader who does not bother with parliament and elections. \n\nUltimately, you’re a man who values freedom, believes in gradual reforms, and has a mixed relationship with both the domestic and global political systems. You trust some institutions, like the armed forces and charities, but feel the world would be a better place with more freedom, democracy, and an emphasis on environmental protection.",
    "12281": "You were born in your home country, and you describe yourself as male. You consider yourself a religious person, belonging to the Roman Catholic denomination, and you believe in God, with a strong level of devotion. However, your belief in religion is somewhat nontraditional, as you view its basic meaning more as a guide for doing good to others rather than strictly following religious norms and ceremonies. You pray several times a week, but you attend religious services less than once a year and do not consider religious faith an important quality for children to learn.\n\nFamily and friends are not central to your life. While you have four children, you do not consider family very important overall. Your parents were both born in your country, though your father was part of the higher administrative group, which likely influenced your upbringing. You have not lived with your parents or in-laws and do not trust your family very much. You also feel somewhat distant from your village, town, or city. Friends, in general, are not very important to you, though you occasionally discuss political matters with them.\n\nYou are a citizen of this country, and you strongly identify with its nationality.

You are a member of a political party but not active, and you might encourage others to vote or take political action, although you haven’t done so yet. You believe that the most important goal for the country over the next ten years should be making cities and the countryside more beautiful. \n\nYour political beliefs are characterized by a preference for freedom over equality, though you still see both as important. You consider freedom more important than equality, and while you somewhat favor individual responsibility, you also believe that the government has a role in addressing economic inequalities. You agree that the government should tax the rich and subsidize the poor, which you see as an essential feature of democracy. However, you also believe that the government should not monitor all emails or information exchanged on the Internet, though you feel it is acceptable for them to collect information about residents without their knowledge. You have quite a lot of confidence in NATO, major companies, environmental organizations, and labor unions but have little trust in the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the IMF, the European Union, or the United Nations.\n\nYou hold some rather clear opinions about various political and societal issues.

You also do not mind having immigrants or foreign workers living next door, and you believe that immigration fills important job vacancies. You strongly disagree with the idea that people who don’t work turn lazy and disagree that men should have more right to jobs than women when jobs are scarce. However, you have some reservations about competition, believing it to be good with some concerns about its harm. You also disagree with the idea that immigration leads to social conflict, and you do not believe that immigrants have a negative effect on unemployment or terrorism risks. \n\nIn terms of society and morality, you find it hard to say which moral rules are the right ones to follow, but you value tolerance and respect for others as important qualities for children to learn. You do not consider thrift or obedience to be important qualities for children, but you place significant value on determination, perseverance, and unselfishness as qualities to be taught to children. You do not consider hard work, saving money, or religious faith to be particularly important for children to learn. When it comes to political or social issues, you might join a boycott, sign an electronic petition, or encourage others to take political action online. You have also expressed that you would not mind more emphasis being placed on technological development or a system where the army rules the country.\n\nYou believe that voters in your country are rarely threatened or bribed at the polls, and that election officials are fair more often than not. However, you also see corruption as an issue within your country. While you believe some corruption exists in your country, you feel it is relatively limited, and you think most of the state authorities are involved in it. You have some reservations about the integrity of political parties and politicians, and you feel that most of the media outlets provide fair coverage of elections.\n\nIn terms of your personal and professional life, you work or have worked in the private sector, specifically within a professional or technical field, and you are the chief wage earner in your household. You are not particularly close to your neighbors or family, but you trust people you know personally somewhat. You have a moderate level of concern about financial insecurity and job loss. You are somewhat dissatisfied with your financial situation, rating it at a 4 out of 10, but you and your family have never gone without enough food or a safe shelter in the past year. Despite your dissatisfaction with financial matters, you feel secure overall. You have never carried a weapon for security reasons, nor do you avoid carrying money for safety.\n\nThough you are not particularly close to the world or to broader society, you are actively involved in environmental and consumer organizations. You care about the planet and its future, but you also value a society based on progress through reform rather than abrupt change. You consider making cities and the countryside more beautiful a top priority and believe in making gradual improvements to society. You also support social organizations such as women's groups and universities, though you are not very active in them.\n\nOn matters of justice, you have a strong sense of right and wrong. You strongly disagree with the idea that it’s acceptable for someone to accept a bribe, and you also believe that stealing property, suicide, or cheating on taxes is almost never justified. You have quite a lot of confidence in the courts, but not in the police, banks, or the armed forces. \n\nWhen it comes to personal freedoms, you believe that security is slightly more important than freedom, and you value your individual freedom to some degree. You are not worried about political violence, terrorist attacks, or civil wars, but you do worry about losing your job or facing financial struggles. \n\nYou do not consider yourself to be very close to your continent or the world as a whole, but you do feel somewhat close to your county, region, or district.

You value personal freedom, but you are also quite aware of the risks posed by corruption and inequality in society.",

God is extremely important to you, ranking a 9 out of 10 in terms of significance. You strongly believe that the core purpose of religion is to do good to others, rather than to strictly follow norms and ceremonies. You believe in God, in heaven, and in hell, and you see the meaning of religion as something that helps make sense of life in this world, rather than focusing on the afterlife.\n\nYour family is also important to you, with one child who you care for deeply. You are the chief wage earner in your household, which consists of you and one other person. You live independently and are not residing with your parents or in-laws. Your mother was born in Country 124, and your father was born in a different country, Country 124. Despite the difference in nationality, you consider yourself quite proud to be of your country's nationality and are very satisfied with your financial situation. Your father holds a Master's degree, and you have also achieved a similar level of education, having completed a Master's degree or equivalent.\n\nYou are a member of a political party, though you are not active within it.

You feel that democracy, including honest elections, is crucial for your country’s well-being. You strongly support the idea that people should choose their leaders in free elections and agree that having a system where everyone has equal rights, including women, is essential to democracy. \n\nHowever, you also have strong opinions about governance and the role of authority. You believe that maintaining order in the nation is the most important goal for the country, and you would be open to a system where experts, not the government, make decisions based on what they think is best for the country. Despite this, you also feel that there should be a strong leader who does not need to deal with parliament and elections. In some respects, you support the idea of religious authorities interpreting the laws in a way that ensures social order.\n\nWhile you have confidence in several institutions like the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and environmental organizations, you lack trust in others, particularly the World Bank, political parties, and the press. You also feel that corruption is a significant problem within your country, although you have confidence in the European Union and major companies. Despite your distrust in some areas, you are extremely satisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country, rating it a 9 out of 10.\n\nWhen it comes to society and its values, you place significant importance on hard work and believe that in the long run, it brings a better life. This belief extends to the way you raise your child, as you consider determination and perseverance important qualities for them to learn. Additionally, you believe that children should learn the importance of not being selfish, but you don't see obedience, tolerance, or respect for other people as essential qualities. You do not find good manners to be particularly important either. \n\nYour personal views on various societal issues show a mix of traditional and more pragmatic perspectives.

Despite these views, you support immigration when there are available jobs, and you trust people of another religion somewhat, but you would not want unmarried couples, people of a different race, or people with AIDS as neighbors. \n\nYou also have a strong stance on personal freedoms. While you believe the government should not monitor all emails and other forms of communication, you do think they should have the right to collect information about people without their knowledge. Furthermore, you believe that governments should be able to monitor people’s movements via video surveillance in public areas. You are a strong believer in security over freedom, rating security as more important. You also strongly feel that the government should take more responsibility to ensure that everyone is provided for, rating this a 1 out of 10 in terms of importance. However, you believe that certain activities, like stealing or accepting bribes, are often justified, rating them at 8 or 9 on a scale of justification.\n\nYour views on certain social issues reflect both conservative and pragmatic outlooks. For example, you strongly agree that divorce is almost always justified and that abortion is somewhat unjustified. You hold a strong belief in the importance of women's rights and equality but also think that women have less opportunity to run for public office. You agree that women are generally less corrupt than men and strongly believe that women having the same rights as men is essential for a democracy.\n\nYou are also quite engaged in political activism.

You do not regularly attend religious services, attending only once a year to pray.

You believe that in the long run, hard work usually results in a better life, though you are not overly concerned with the role of luck and connections in success.\n\nThough your opinion on immigration is nuanced, you support the idea that the government should allow people to come to the country if jobs are available, acknowledging that immigration helps fill important job vacancies. However, you also believe immigration can lead to social conflict and increase the risks of terrorism. You find it difficult to judge whether immigration provides asylum to political refugees or increases unemployment.

Instead, you prioritize qualities like thrift, saving money, and respecting others, along with the importance of competition, freedom, and the right to pursue happiness.

While you belong to the Protestant denomination, you are not particularly active in religious services or practices, never or practically never praying, and do not attend religious services regularly. God is moderately important to you, scoring a 7 out of 10 in importance. Your views on religion also reflect a broader tolerance, as you strongly disagree that your religion is the only acceptable one and do not believe in concepts such as hell or heaven. Nevertheless, you still consider yourself a religious person, and you value religious tolerance, as well as the idea that homosexual couples can be just as good parents as heterosexual couples.\n\nIn terms of beliefs and values, you strongly prioritize freedom. Whether it’s in balancing freedom against equality or security, freedom always takes precedence for you. You are also committed to democratic principles, firmly believing that living in a country with free elections, a democratic political system, and equal rights for all citizens is crucial. You see the right to vote in free elections as an absolutely essential characteristic of democracy, and you participate actively in national and local elections, always casting your vote. \n\nThough you hold these democratic values, you have a complicated relationship with various political systems and ideologies. For instance, while you strongly believe in having democratic systems of governance, you would not favor a system governed solely by religious law without political parties or elections. You are also somewhat open to strong leadership, though not to the extent of desiring rule by an army or military forces. Your opinion on economic and governmental matters leans towards a mixed approach: you moderately believe that the government should take more responsibility for ensuring that everyone is provided for, with limited emphasis on individual responsibility. \n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in various global organizations, such as NATO, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and the International Monetary Fund. However, you are less trusting of the United Nations and the European Union. You have a strong belief in the importance of honest elections, free of corruption, violence, or unfair influence from political parties or wealthy elites. You also think that voters are often offered a genuine choice in elections and that votes are counted fairly.\n\nWhile you have great confidence in the functioning of the political system in your country, you do not belong to any political party, nor are you a member of any professional, environmental, or art-related organizations.

Despite your deep belief in democracy, you do not actively engage in political movements or protests.\n\nYou have an independent stance on immigration, where you believe in strict limits on the number of foreigners coming to work in your country. At the same time, you recognize the importance of immigration in providing asylum to political refugees and offering people from poorer countries a better life.

You believe that people who do not work are not necessarily lazy and that immigration does not lead to unemployment or terrorism.

You have no problem with unmarried couples living together or with having neighbors who speak a different language, hold a different religion, or even have AIDS.\n\nYour attitude towards social justice and human rights aligns with your core values of equality and freedom. You believe women have equal opportunities to run for public office in your country, and that it is essential for women to have the same rights as men in all aspects of life.

You also think that unselfishness, thrift, and saving money are not essential qualities for children to learn, though you do place a high value on teaching children the importance of respect for others and tolerance.\n\nWhen it comes to economic issues, you believe that economic growth and job creation should be top priorities for the country, even if it means some environmental harm. However, you do not think that the environment should be entirely sacrificed for economic growth. You are very satisfied with your household’s financial situation and are moderately confident that the government should take steps to reduce economic inequality, such as taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor. You are also not entirely opposed to having a system that redistributes wealth in a limited way.\n\nYour confidence in institutions extends to the financial sector, where you trust banks, the courts, and the police. While you have a fair amount of confidence in the press and in charitable organizations, you are less convinced about the fairness of the United Nations or the European Union. You trust your family and neighborhood completely, and you believe that most people can be trusted in general. \n\nIn terms of personal interests, you do not heavily rely on social media or the Internet for information, and you obtain news from traditional sources like newspapers and email on a relatively infrequent basis. Your phone serves as another occasional information source, but your consumption of media is selective. You have a particular interest in the development of technology, believing it will create opportunities for future generations.\n\nIn your local community, you are fortunate to not encounter many social issues. There is no police or military interference with private life in your neighborhood, nor do you experience street violence, racism, or drug sales. While you believe that there is little risk of bribes or corruption in your area, you do recognize that there is some level of corruption in the country as a whole, though it is minimal. \n\nOn a personal level, you are happy with your life, feeling secure and in control of your future, with substantial freedom of choice.

Together, you live in a household with four members, including yourself. \n\nReligion plays an extremely important role in your life, and you are a devout member of the Muslim denomination. You attend religious services more than once a week and pray several times a day. For you, the basic meaning of religion is about following religious norms and ceremonies rather than doing good to others, though you also value religious faith as an important quality for children to learn. You strongly believe that your religion is the only acceptable one and have a great deal of confidence in the churches. Your beliefs extend to other aspects of your life, as you hold that women should have equal rights with men, and you value the importance of religious faith for your children. \n\nFamily is of paramount importance to you. You have four children and, as a parent, feel that good manners and respect for others are key qualities to nurture in them. You also believe in the importance of tolerance and respect for others, although you do not consider determination or perseverance as essential qualities for children to learn. You strongly agree that making your parents proud is one of your main goals in life.\n\nYou maintain strong beliefs about democracy, governance, and political systems. You believe that living in a country governed democratically is crucial and that having free elections with people choosing their leaders is an essential part of democracy. You strongly support the idea of gender equality in political office, believing that women should have equal opportunities to run for public office fairly often in your country. You value honest elections and believe that it’s very important for votes to be counted fairly in elections. You also have confidence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the World Bank, the World Health Organization, and the European Union. You trust major companies and believe in the importance of a stable economy, especially in terms of economic growth. \n\nYou are skeptical, however, about the political landscape in your country. While you believe that elections in your country are not always free from corruption or biased media coverage, you still think that political violence is almost never justified. Your satisfaction with the political system in your country is moderate (level 7 out of 10), though you don’t consider politics to be very important in your life. You do not belong to any political party or professional association, but you do occasionally discuss political matters with friends. You believe that a high level of economic growth should be the primary goal for your country over the next decade and that protecting the environment should also take priority, even if it slows down economic growth.\n\nOn the subject of immigration, you hold strict views. You believe the government should limit the number of foreigners who can come to your country and agree that immigration can lead to social conflict. You also believe that immigration increases unemployment and does not provide a better life for people from poorer countries. However, you are not against having immigrants or foreign workers as neighbors, as you do not mind having people who speak a different language or come from a different race or religion living next to you.\n\nIn terms of law and order, you feel that maintaining order in the nation is of utmost importance, but you are not a fan of the military or police interfering with people's private lives. You believe that protecting people's human rights is an important value for your country, but you also think that individuals should be held accountable for their actions, particularly when it comes to bribery. Corruption is something you view as widespread in your country, and you are skeptical of most local and state authorities, believing that they are often involved in corrupt activities. You strongly believe that those who are found guilty of giving or receiving bribes should be held accountable.\n\nYour views on crime, justice, and moral values are fairly conservative. You believe that stealing property and prostitution are rarely justified and view both as wrong. Similarly, you feel that violence against others is almost never justified, and you strongly agree that people who don't work are lazy. While you are concerned about terrorism and civil war, you do not see political violence or the breaking of laws as acceptable solutions to societal problems. You would not be inclined to support any form of protest or political activity online, nor would you ever organize political events in that manner. \n\nYour confidence in the press is high, although you feel that TV news in your country often favors the governing party. You also have faith in the press's ability to provide fairly neutral coverage during elections, but you're wary of political manipulation and bias. You would never encourage others to engage in political activities online, though you might support a boycott or a petition. \n\nOn a more personal level, you consider your neighborhood to be a generally peaceful place, with no significant occurrences of crime, drug sales, or violence. You do, however, value safety and have avoided carrying much money for security reasons. Although you are worried about issues such as terrorism, civil war, and not being able to provide your children with a good education, you feel secure in your current living situation. You rarely went without a safe shelter or medical care in the past year, and you are very satisfied with your household's financial situation.\n\nWhile you are open-minded about some aspects of life, such as having neighbors of different faiths or races, you also have clear limits when it comes to other social issues. For example, you would not like to have people with AIDS or heavy drinkers as neighbors, and you feel that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay. You believe that the government should not monitor emails or personal information on the Internet, but you are comfortable with video surveillance in public areas.\n\nUltimately, you believe that individual rights and security should be balanced, and that a stable society is built on respect, family, and strong moral values. You trust your family completely and feel that you have a great deal of control over your life. Despite your concerns about corruption and the political system, you remain a proud citizen of your country and deeply committed to your faith, family, and community.",

However, religion is not particularly central to your daily activities, and you rarely attend religious services, praying only once a year. You are not a member of any religious denomination or church, and you are not very involved in religious or spiritual organizations. Despite this, you find that God remains quite important to you, ranking an 8 out of 10 in terms of significance. \n\nOn the matter of relationships and societal norms, you strongly believe that homosexual couples can be just as good parents as other couples.

You also strongly disagree with the idea that voters are often bribed in this country's elections, although you do believe that voters are threatened with violence at the polls.\n\nYou trust people you know personally, but you are very cautious when it comes to dealing with others in general, as you feel that people should be handled with care. You trust people from other nationalities somewhat but do not have confidence in international institutions, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, or the European Union. Your mistrust extends to the media, as you have no confidence in the press, journalists, or coverage of elections in this country, and you do not rely on emails, social media, or other forms of digital communication for information.\n\nRegarding societal issues, you strongly agree that people who don't work turn lazy and that immigration fills important job vacancies. You are not worried much about terrorism or civil war, but you are concerned about a potential war involving your country. You also believe that street violence and fights, as well as police or military interference with private life, are frequent occurrences in your neighborhood. You view the fight against crime as the most important societal goal and believe maintaining order in the nation should be the second most important priority. Despite these concerns, you are not particularly worried about losing your job, though you do worry a good deal about not finding one.\n\nWhile you consider some degree of social reform necessary, you have no faith in major companies, banks, or environmental organizations. You strongly believe that competition is harmful, and you think the government should take more responsibility in ensuring that everyone is provided for. You also believe that the government should have the right to collect information about anyone living in the country without their knowledge and should ensure that people’s incomes are equal. You strongly support the idea of government taxation of the rich to subsidize the poor, and you feel strongly that a government that helps its people is essential. However, you do not find it important for the state to make people's incomes equal, nor do you consider living in a democratic country to be crucial.\n\nYour opinion about science and technology is quite critical. You feel that science has contributed to a breakdown in people’s moral sense, which you rate a 10 out of 10 in terms of its negative impact. You also believe that the world is a worse place because of science and technology. Furthermore, you do not believe that science or technology will provide more opportunities for the next generation, and you rate this a 1 out of 10. \n\nYou are rather dissatisfied with your life overall, as you rate your current life satisfaction a 4 out of 10, and your financial situation is also a source of discontent. Despite this, you still find some moments of happiness and feel that you need to gradually improve society through reforms. \n\nThough you are skeptical of many aspects of modern life, you remain committed to the idea of helping others and have quite a lot of confidence in charitable or humanitarian organizations. You have a moderate amount of confidence in the courts and women’s organizations, but you do not trust labor unions or the police. Your confidence in the armed forces is also quite high, though you are critical of corruption within local and state authorities, rating it a 10 out of 10. \n\nIn terms of personal values, you do not find leisure time very important, nor do you believe that competition is a positive force. You strongly agree that being a housewife is just as fulfilling as working for pay, and you do not see work as a duty toward society. Despite your belief in the importance of strong defense forces for your country, you find that living a life of freedom is more important to you than the sense of security. You value freedom over equality and security, believing that people should have the freedom to choose their lives and their paths.\n\nLastly, your feelings toward your country are complicated. While you do not feel particularly proud to be from your country, you do feel somewhat connected to it, and you consider yourself very close to your continent and to the world in general. However, you do not feel very close to your county, region, or district, nor do you have a strong connection to your village, town, or city. You are, however, somewhat dissatisfied with the way the political system is functioning in your country, and you have no confidence in its electoral process.",

You have no children as of now but agree that it is a duty towards society to have children.\n\nYou consider yourself a religious person, as religion is quite important in your life. You belong to the Muslim denomination and attend religious services once a month. God plays a very important role in your life, and you believe in heaven, hell, and life after death. For you, the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people rather than following religious norms and ceremonies. You pray several times each week and have a strong belief that your religion is the only acceptable one.\n\nYour views on politics and society are shaped by your background and experiences. You actively engage in political matters, discussing them occasionally with friends and sometimes encouraging others to vote or take political action online. You are also actively involved in a political party, a labor union, and several organizations, though not in an active capacity. You believe that the country should be governed by a democratic system, with elections and political parties playing a critical role in shaping the future. You strongly believe that living in a country that is governed democratically is absolutely important, and you consider freedom of speech a key priority for the country. However, you do not feel satisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country and believe that corruption is widespread among the local authorities, state authorities, and political parties. This sense of frustration also extends to your lack of confidence in the press, the courts, and various international organizations like the IMF, the United Nations, and the World Health Organization.\n\nWhile you do believe that government should ensure the welfare of all citizens, you lean towards a greater responsibility of the individual and worry about the consequences of too much government intervention. You also think that economic growth and job creation should be prioritized, even if the environment is affected. You believe that competition can be harmful, though you see some benefit to it. You are somewhat skeptical about the effectiveness of environmental organizations, labor unions, and charitable or humanitarian groups.\n\nOn social issues, your views are also shaped by your cultural background and religious beliefs. You consider tolerance and respect for others important qualities for children to learn, though you believe certain behaviors, like stealing, prostitution, and violence, are never justified. You feel strongly that certain actions, such as accepting a bribe or cheating on taxes, are completely unacceptable. You strongly oppose homosexuality, arguing that homosexual couples are not as good parents as other couples. You would not want people with AIDS, drug addicts, or heavy drinkers as neighbors, reflecting a conservative stance on these issues. You are also opposed to unmarried couples living together, believing that family structures should follow traditional norms.

You obtain information weekly or daily, and while you do not completely trust the press, you believe voters are offered a genuine choice in most elections. You are not afraid to sign petitions or participate in boycotts or demonstrations, though you have not taken many actions yet. You also consider yourself moderately involved in politics, both offline and online, and have encouraged others to take political action before. However, your trust in political institutions, such as the press, government officials, and election processes, is rather low, as you believe they often lean towards corruption and bias.\n\nYour relationship with your spouse is relatively stable. You do not mind having different political views or living situations compared to your neighbors, although you hold conservative views on certain moral and societal issues. You might even consider it important for your children to learn qualities like determination, perseverance, and unselfishness, but you hold the view that hard work, rather than luck, is necessary for success. You also believe that women should have the same opportunities as men to hold political office, but you do not see women's participation as making a huge difference in politics.\n\nOverall, you value stability, security, and personal responsibility in life, while remaining deeply connected to your family, religion, and cultural values. Despite feeling some dissatisfaction with the political system, your commitment to ensuring that future generations understand the importance of both hard work and good manners underscores your approach to life and its challenges.",

You are a Muslim, and God holds the utmost importance for you. You believe that the core meaning of religion is to do good to others rather than simply adhering to religious norms and ceremonies. You also attend religious services once a month and pray daily. Your religious faith is something you instill in your children, as you consider it an essential quality for them to learn. You are a very religious person, and you strongly believe that your religion is the only acceptable one. You also believe in heaven, hell, and life after death, and have a deep commitment to these beliefs. \n\nYour family life is deeply important to you. You are married and have one child. Your spouse comes from a background of farm labor, and you both live with two other people in your household. Your mother and father were both born in country 50, and neither of your parents had much formal education. Your father belonged to the farm worker group, and your mother had only early childhood education. You were not born into wealth, but you've worked hard to achieve a stable life for yourself and your family. \n\nDespite your solid foundation, you do not consider yourself to be a part of the upper class. You describe yourself as belonging to the lower middle class, but you are largely satisfied with your financial situation. You are not the chief wage earner in the household, and your spouse has completed primary education. You have never had a job yourself, and your spouse is or was self-employed. \n\nYour view on politics is shaped by a desire for a system that maintains order and stability while also aligning with your strong religious values. You believe that a system where religion governs the laws is not ideal, and you would prefer a democracy, though you have concerns about its flaws. You believe that living in a democracy is important, but you feel that the current political system needs reforms to improve its functioning. You believe in having free elections where votes are counted fairly, though you also think that opposition candidates are often prevented from running and that electoral corruption is a significant issue. You have little faith in political parties and have no affiliation with any party. You are also not a member of any professional association, and politics does not feature prominently in your friendships or daily life.\n\nYou are a strong believer in the importance of work and see it as a duty toward society. You think that work should always come first, even if it means less leisure time. You strongly believe that adult children should care for their parents in the long term, and you agree that men should have more rights to a job than women when jobs are scarce. You believe in the value of hard work, believing that it usually brings a better life in the long run. However, you also feel that it would be bad to place less importance on work in people's lives.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign workers, you believe the government should place strict limits on the number of immigrants, as you are concerned that immigration increases social conflict and might also increase the risks of terrorism. While you believe immigration does fill important job vacancies, you are worried that the influx of immigrants can bring social challenges. Additionally, you are wary of having people from other countries, or those who speak a different language, live as neighbors.\n\nYou are critical of the idea of greater competition in society, but you also think it can have benefits. You are more concerned about its potential harms and prefer to maintain some caution about how competition affects communities. You do not have much confidence in the courts, but you trust the police and believe that the police are not involved in corruption in your area. You feel a strong sense of trust in your family, neighborhood, and even charitable or humanitarian organizations, but you have little faith in the media. You believe that journalists provide fair coverage of elections only occasionally, and that the media is often corrupt. You also don't trust the government officials, and you would never contact them.\n\nWhile you support the idea of progress, especially in terms of science and technology, you are deeply conflicted when it comes to the relationship between science and religion. You strongly believe that religion is always right when it conflicts with science, and you are not afraid of the consequences of this viewpoint. You do not think a university education is inherently more important for a boy than for a girl, but you also don't consider science to be an everyday necessity for life. \n\nYour views on society reflect a strong sense of moral responsibility and order. You believe that there is extensive corruption in the country, and you strongly feel that government should take more responsibility for ensuring the welfare of all citizens. You feel it is important for people to obey their rulers, seeing it as an essential characteristic of democracy, though you are deeply wary of any form of government that undermines individual rights or relies on an authoritarian approach.\n\nOn the global stage, you have quite a lot of confidence in international organizations like NATO, the World Bank, the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Health Organization. However, you also believe that your country should be governed by a strong leader who maintains control, rather than relying on expert decision-making or a system that is too decentralized. You value maintaining order in your country and are especially wary of any system governed by religious law, where political parties or elections are absent. \n\nYou also hold firm opinions on several social issues. For example, you believe that unmarried couples living together, people with AIDS, and drug addicts would not make good neighbors. You have an intensely conservative stance on issues such as abortion, divorce, prostitution, and homosexuality, believing that none of these are ever justified. You are opposed to any form of political violence and believe that it is never justified. Furthermore, you believe that women having the same rights as men is an essential part of democracy, but you also think that men make better political leaders.\n\nIn terms of your economic and social values, you are proud to say that you do not mind a society that places more emphasis on technological development or on the development of competition. You would also prefer that thrift and saving money be emphasized as important qualities for children to learn. You do not place much importance on the idea of leisure time, considering it to be secondary to the duty of hard work. You believe in the importance of respecting authority and consider this an essential value for children. \n\nLastly, your concern for a better future for your child drives much of your outlook. You are deeply worried about your ability to provide them with a good education and make sure that they have opportunities for a better life. You are committed to making your parents proud, and you see their respect and care as a legacy you want to pass on. Despite the many concerns you may have about society and the future, you remain content and satisfied with your life overall, feeling that the hard work you have invested has brought stability and purpose to your family.",

Despite your stance on immigration, you do not mind having people of different races, religions, or nationalities as neighbors, as long as they respect your way of life.\n\nYou place a high value on security and feel that it is more important than freedom. For you, security means knowing that your family is safe from harm, that there are laws in place to protect your rights, and that you have the ability to provide for your children. You have avoided carrying large sums of money for security reasons and have carried a knife, gun, or other weapon as a precaution.

You occasionally discuss political matters with friends, though politics is not a major focus in your life. You agree that people who don't work turn lazy and that work is a duty toward society. You do not feel it is your duty to encourage others to vote or to take action on political issues. You are more concerned about other aspects of life, such as family, work, and security. You believe that voters in your country are not often threatened with violence or bribed in elections, and you also feel that election officials are generally fair.\n\nYou do not feel close to your continent, region, or district, but you do feel a strong connection to your village, town, or city.

    "34672": "You were born in country 360 and are deeply tied to your national identity, feeling quite proud of your country’s nationality. You were raised in a family where religion was a central pillar of life. Your father was born in this country, and he worked as an unskilled laborer, a role that you can relate to as you also belong to the working class. Your mother, who was born in this country as well, completed primary education, and while she was never extremely involved in formal education, she instilled in you a strong sense of family values. You are female, and you have one child, whom you consider central to your life, along with your religious beliefs. You are actively involved in your church and attend religious services once a week. You pray several times a day and hold God as the most important aspect of your life.\n\nFamily is crucial to you, and you live with both your parents-in-law and your spouse, who also works as a full-time employee. Your spouse, like your father, belongs to the unskilled worker group, and has completed lower secondary education. Together, you live in a household of four people. Your mother has always worked hard to provide for your family, and you value both family life and the importance of religious faith. \n\nAlthough you’re proud of your roots, you’re cautious about other influences. You do not trust people from other religions at all, and you strongly believe that your religion is the only acceptable one. You wouldn’t want people of a different religion, race, or nationality as neighbors, nor would you want anyone who has AIDS or drug addicts living next to you. For similar reasons, you’re opposed to immigration, believing that the government should prohibit people from coming to work in your country and that immigration leads to social conflict. You don’t think immigration fills important job vacancies, and you believe that people from other countries are unlikely to improve your country's well-being. You also don’t believe that immigration provides asylum to political refugees. \n\nDespite these views, you feel fairly secure in your daily life. You’ve never gone without shelter, food, or income in the past year. Your family has not been a victim of crime recently, and street violence, sexual harassment, and drug sales do not occur in your neighborhood. In your view, the government should have the right to monitor emails, collect information without consent, and surveil public spaces, believing that these actions are necessary for maintaining safety and security. Your confidence in your government is low, but you also feel that there’s respect for individual human rights in your country, although you don’t believe political violence or opposition candidates being prevented from running are common occurrences. \n\nAlthough you’re not completely satisfied with the political system, you are neither particularly satisfied nor dissatisfied with how elections work, noting that you don’t trust the media to provide fair coverage. You’re not confident in political parties or most authorities, who you believe are involved in corruption. You generally feel that most journalists and media people are corrupt, and you’re skeptical of most international organizations like the United Nations, the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization. You believe that the system could benefit from a strong leader who doesn't need to deal with parliament or elections.\n\nYour views on politics are somewhat contradictory, as you feel it’s fairly good to have a democratic system but also favor less reliance on elections. You do not believe it’s essential for people to choose their leaders through free elections, and you are neutral about whether living in a democracy is of great importance. Still, you are active in political matters in a limited way, being a member of a political party (though not an active participant). You vote in both national and local elections but would never encourage others to take action about political issues. You’re not confident in the fairness of elections, believing that votes are not counted fairly in your country and that election officials are often not fair.\n\nAs someone who values traditional views, you believe that men should have more right to jobs than women, especially in times of scarcity. You are also of the opinion that women can be fulfilling housewives, just as fulfilling as working for pay. While you do believe that men often make better political leaders than women, you think that women can run for public office fairly often in your country. You also hold some traditional views on family roles, agreeing that adult children should provide long-term care for their parents and that good manners and religious faith are important qualities for children to learn.\n\nHowever, you are not opposed to all social changes. You believe that protecting the environment should be a priority, even at the cost of some economic growth or job loss, and you also support the idea that cities and the countryside should become more beautiful in the future. At the same time, you don’t mind the development of technology, even though you do not consider it particularly important for your daily life. You do not seek to acquire much information from modern sources like the Internet, email, or social media, preferring instead to rely on more traditional means of communication. You’re not very involved in any consumer, environmental, or self-help organizations, and you do not have confidence in labor unions, charitable organizations, or universities.\n\nYour views on crime, society, and moral issues show a firm sense of right and wrong. You strongly oppose any form of stealing, bribery, or cheating on taxes and believe that people should not justify immoral actions under any circumstances. You feel that violence is somewhat unjustified, and although you don’t condone political violence, you believe it’s sometimes hard to know what the right moral rules are. You also feel that ordinary people rarely have to pay bribes to local officials, and you think that society must be gradually improved by reforms.\n\nAlthough you hold these firm beliefs, you also believe in the importance of respecting others. Tolerance and respect are important qualities for children to learn, and you value non-selfishness and obedience. However, your sense of security comes with caution, as you believe it’s important to be very careful when dealing with people. You trust your family completely, but you don’t trust people around you or in your neighborhood much, considering them potentially unreliable.\n\nAt the end of the day, you feel somewhat satisfied with your life and are content with the simple pleasures of family and religion, though you remain wary of the outside world. You are not someone who seeks fame, but rather the comfort of your close circle, and you would never encourage others to take political action or attend demonstrations. Despite the flaws you perceive in society, you are proud of your roots, value your family above all, and hold your religious convictions firmly.",

Despite this, you do not feel very close to your continent or to the world in general.\n\nWhen it comes to societal issues, you believe that individuals should take more responsibility to provide for themselves and that people who don't work turn lazy.

You also think that journalists rarely provide fair coverage of elections and that voters are sometimes bribed or threatened with violence at the polls. You have some confidence in charitable organizations and banks, and you are somewhat confident in environmental organizations, labor unions, and universities. However, you feel that corruption is widespread in your country and that local and national authorities are often involved in corrupt practices.\n\nYou value security and would consider it more important than freedom, believing that safety should come before personal freedoms. You are also concerned about surveillance and would not mind the government having the right to monitor information exchanged on the Internet or to collect information about individuals without their knowledge.

You are the secondary wage earner in your household, while your spouse, who belongs to the professional and technical group and has completed post-secondary education, works full-time. You also obtain information daily from emails, mobile phones, social media, and the Internet. You subscribe to a weekly newspaper but do not actively seek political news online or participate in political actions.\n\nDespite your political dissatisfaction, you would consider joining a peaceful demonstration or boycott, though you would never organize political events online.

However, you also think that science and technology have drawbacks, such as breaking down traditional moral concepts.\n\nYou do not consider yourself very close to the world or to your continent, but you do feel a sense of belonging to your country and region. You would not like to live in a system governed by religious law or by the army, and you believe that there should be less emphasis on work in life.

You live in a household of four people, including yourself. Family is very important to you, and you place a significant value on your relationships with both close family and friends. While your spouse has never had a job, they have completed primary education. You, on the other hand, have completed primary education and work in a skilled trade, belonging to the skilled worker group (e.g., foreman, motor mechanic, tool and die maker, etc.). You are the chief wage earner in your household, and you are moderately satisfied with your financial situation (level 7 on a scale of 1-10).\n\nYou consider hard work an important quality for children to learn and believe that it is through effort that people can improve their lives. However, you also value equality over freedom, and would consider equality more important if forced to choose between the two. This reflects your belief that economic growth and job creation should be the country’s top priority, even if it comes at the expense of the environment. You moderately agree that in the long run, hard work brings a better life, with limited concerns about luck and connections.\n\nYour political views are shaped by a complex relationship with democracy and government. You are not a member of any political party, nor do you belong to any professional, art, or educational organizations. You believe that the democratic political system would be fairly bad for governing your country, and that it is somewhat not essential for democracy to involve taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor. You disagree that being governed by religious law or a strong leader who bypasses parliament would be a good system. However, you do consider democracy essential in terms of women's rights, freedom to choose leaders through elections, and ensuring equal rights for both men and women. Despite your relatively moderate views on government, you are moderately dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country (level 3 on a scale of 1-10).\n\nYour stance on certain social and moral issues reveals a firm and conservative outlook. For instance, you believe that divorce, suicide, abortion, and prostitution are almost never justified (all at level 1 on a scale of 1-10), and you would not support unmarried couples living together as neighbors. You feel that religion, while not a central part of your life, has a basic meaning in promoting good behavior toward others rather than following religious ceremonies.

You also do not believe in life after death and have no belief in religious faith for children to learn.\n\nYou have a great deal of confidence in various institutions, including the courts, the police, political parties, banks, and universities, but your views on the press and the churches are less positive.

You agree that immigration leads to social conflict and increases unemployment, but you don’t mind having people of different races, religions, or nationalities as neighbors. You believe that immigration does not fill important job vacancies, and you do not think it provides a better life for people from poor countries. While you believe that immigration increases the risks of terrorism and that it can contribute to a less harmonious society, you still trust people of other nationalities and religions somewhat.\n\nIn terms of social responsibility, you feel that children have a duty toward society to provide long-term care for their parents, and you agree that having children is a duty towards society. You also think that work should always come first, even at the cost of spare time, as it is a fundamental duty toward society. On a personal level, you would never attend a peaceful demonstration, nor would you ever organize political activities or protests online. Additionally, you strongly disagree with the idea of signing electronic petitions or taking political action through online means.\n\nWhile politics and society are important to you, your overall view of life is one of moderate satisfaction.

You have confidence in the police, courts, and banks, and you trust the people you know personally. You also value the importance of loyalty and trust within your family, feeling that you trust your family completely.\n\nYour overall worldview is cautious yet optimistic. You believe in personal responsibility but also understand the need for some government involvement to ensure fairness and equality. Your belief in freedom, security, and economic growth shapes your approach to life and governance. You feel a strong connection to your country, but you are open to social change, even if it is through revolutionary means.

You attend religious services more than once a week, and you strongly believe that God is extremely important in your life. You think the basic meaning of religion is to do good to other people, rather than adhering strictly to religious norms or ceremonies. Additionally, you consider yourself a religious person and you believe in life after death. You also maintain that when science and religion conflict, religion is always right. Your faith is at the heart of your worldview, and you hold that the meaning of religion is not just about life after death, but about making sense of life in this world.\n\nPolitically, you are somewhat involved, as you are actively involved in a political party and sometimes discuss political matters with friends. However, politics is not very important in your life overall. You are a member of a church or religious organization, though not highly active.

You are also largely satisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country (level 7).\n\nYou feel that political violence is never justified, and you strongly oppose any form of terrorism. At the same time, you have concerns about the fairness of elections, noting that votes are not often counted fairly and that election officials are not always fair. You believe that the press often favors the governing party and that journalists don't always provide fair coverage of elections. Corruption is a major issue for you, and you believe there is abundant corruption in your country, as well as in most of the local and state authorities. You don't trust the police, courts, or political parties much either.\n\nRegarding your views on governance, you do not support a democratic political system as a way of governing your country. You find the idea of a system governed by religious law without political parties or elections fairly good. You also believe it would be fairly bad to have a democratic political system in your country, and you feel it would be quite beneficial to have a strong leader who doesn't have to bother with parliament and elections. Despite this, you also feel that maintaining order in the nation is most important and that protecting freedom of speech is the second most crucial goal for your country.\n\nYou consider equality more important than freedom, and you believe that a high level of economic growth should be a primary goal for the country.

You feel moderately secure these days but are cautious about possible threats.\n\nYour relationship with the outside world reflects a certain caution. You trust people from another religion somewhat and have mixed feelings about foreigners coming to your country. While you believe that immigration fills important job vacancies, you think the government should place strict limits on the number of foreigners allowed to work. You also believe that immigration provides a better life for people from poorer countries but think that it can lead to social conflict. As for people of other nationalities, you trust them somewhat but don’t feel very close to your continent. Still, you feel close to your village, town, or city, and you are very proud of your country's nationality.\n\nYour personal beliefs regarding certain social issues are clear-cut. For example, you believe that women have equal opportunities to run for public office and that abortion is never justified. You hold the view that homosexual behavior is never justified, and you do not mind having unmarried couples living together as neighbors. At the same time, you believe that people with AIDS or people of a different race, religion, or language can be your neighbors, displaying a certain level of tolerance toward diversity. However, you are not comfortable with drug addicts living nearby or with neighbors who practice a different religion.\n\nYou view your role in society as one where you should work hard, as you believe that hard work will bring a better life in the long run. You place great importance on this quality and also value good manners and religious faith as important traits to teach children. You feel it is essential for people to take responsibility for themselves, but you don't see competition as entirely positive, and you believe that it can sometimes be harmful. You also think that work should be considered a duty towards society and that leisure time is important, yet it shouldn't be the sole focus of life.\n\nThough you don't actively engage in political protests or boycotts, you might encourage others to vote or take political action online, though you have not done so yet. You would never contact a government official or attend a peaceful demonstration, but you would be willing to fight for your country if a war were to come to that.\n\nIn terms of your personal life, you are a member of a labor union and you work or have worked in the private sector, specifically within the service group. You are a member of a church, though not highly active, and you believe that people should strive to make their parents proud.

While you don’t think a democratic political system is an ideal way of governing the country, you also don’t see a military or authoritarian rule as a good option either.

You are against immigration for economic reasons, believing that the government should prohibit people from coming to your country to work. You see immigration as a source of social conflict, which you believe could increase the risk of terrorism. You also believe it may fill important job vacancies but would not support more immigration in the future. You feel strongly that immigration should be restricted, and you do not mind having immigrants or foreign workers as neighbors, as long as they are not a part of the conflict you perceive surrounding immigration. \n\nYou do not trust people from other religions or nationalities, and you are very cautious when dealing with others.

    "81071": "You were born in country 764 and, throughout your life, you have considered yourself very close to your country, region, and town.

You consider family extremely important and are very proud of your role as the chief wage earner in your home. You live a secure life, and financial stability is a priority for you, as you are very satisfied with your household's financial situation, rating it a 9 out of 10. You occasionally discuss political matters with friends, though you are not a member of any political party and hold little confidence in political parties or the political system in general. You feel quite dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country, giving it a 1 on a scale of 1-10.\n\nYou are a male who works or has worked in a private business or industry. You hold a Bachelor's degree or equivalent and are quite confident in your ability to succeed in life, emphasizing hard work and some reliance on luck or connections. You believe that both hard work and luck/connections are important for success, with a slight emphasis on hard work. You are very much a believer in technology and its role in improving life, strongly agreeing that science and technology make the world a much better place and will create more opportunities for future generations.\n\nYou describe yourself as belonging to the upper middle class and, despite having a strong sense of pride for your country, you are critical of the corruption that you believe permeates local and state authorities. You strongly feel that there is abundant corruption in your country and that most authorities, both state and local, are involved in it. This aligns with your belief that political violence is never justified and that ordinary people often have to resort to bribery or favor exchanges to get the services they need from local officials. \n\nIn terms of religion, you are a follower of Buddhism and place considerable importance on the idea that religion is about doing good to others rather than adhering to strict religious norms or ceremonies. While religion is important in your life, you are not particularly devout, attending services only on special holy days, and you do not consider religious faith to be an essential quality for children to learn. You find that, in general, religion should make sense of life in the world rather than focus solely on life after death. You also do not believe in God and do not think that religious faith plays a significant role in guiding moral behavior.\n\nRegarding social issues, you hold somewhat traditional views. You believe that both men and women should have equal opportunities, especially in political office, but also recognize that certain values, such as good manners and determination, are important qualities for children to learn. You do not consider unselfishness or obedience to be critical qualities for children, but you emphasize the importance of teaching children to work hard and persevere. However, when it comes to social changes such as immigration, you have mixed feelings. On one hand, you believe immigration fills important job vacancies and offers people from poorer countries a better life, but you also feel that strict limits should be placed on the number of immigrants allowed to come to your country due to concerns about social conflict and increased unemployment.\n\nYou are somewhat skeptical of people of other religions and nationalities, trusting them less than those within your own group. You also distrust the press and are not confident in major companies, environmental organizations, or labor unions. You believe that, while people are generally not threatened with violence at the polls, there is often corruption in the electoral process, with wealthy individuals influencing elections. You are not particularly worried about a terrorist attack or a civil war, but you are concerned about the risks that immigration may bring, including the potential for terrorism. You also don’t believe that women earning more than their husbands will create problems, and you agree that homosexual couples make as good parents as others.\n\nPolitically, you feel that having a democratic system of governance would be very beneficial for your country, as it would give people more say in important decisions. However, you also feel that a strong leader who does not have to deal with elections or parliament could be a good way to govern, as long as the leader is effective. You believe the government should not have the right to monitor personal communications, such as emails or the information exchanged on the internet, and you are against video surveillance in public areas. At the same time, you are very critical of the idea that democracy should involve a strong emphasis on equality through government intervention. You believe that taxing the rich and subsidizing the poor is not essential for democracy and that it is far more important for people to choose their leaders through free elections.\n\nYou are not very worried about losing your job or not being able to find one, and you are also not concerned about having to make ends meet when it comes to basic needs like food, shelter, or medical treatment. Despite your somewhat traditional views, you are quite progressive when it comes to the role of women, as you believe that women having the same rights as men is a crucial characteristic of democracy. You also believe that everyone should obey their rulers and that this, too, is essential for a democracy to function.\n\nAlthough you trust your family completely and find friends important, you do not place much trust in people in general, particularly those of a different religion, nationality, or background. You hold that there is a lack of respect for individual rights in your country and feel that society has a long way to go in terms of reform. You feel that technology development should be prioritized and are generally optimistic about its impact on the next generation, although you have mixed views on competition and whether it is ultimately good or harmful for society. \n\nLastly, despite your mixed feelings about social and political reforms, you strongly agree that your country should focus on economic growth and job creation as the most important goals over the next decade, even if it means sacrificing some environmental considerations. You have little confidence in environmental organizations and major corporations, but you do believe in the value of humanitarian organizations, universities, and charitable efforts. \n\nIn terms of everyday life, you maintain a level of caution regarding security and have avoided carrying much money or weapons for personal safety, while still feeling very secure in your current living situation.

    "6007": "You were born in country 50, where you have lived most of your life. Family is central to you, and you have a deep pride in your nationality. You are male, married, and have two children. You describe yourself as belonging to the lower middle class. Your mother was born in this country and has no formal education, while your father was born in country 50 as well. Interestingly, neither of your parents ever had a job, and your spouse has never had a job either, instead fulfilling the role of a housewife. You consider yourself a religious person, with God being extremely important in your life, and you attend religious services more than once a week. Your religious beliefs shape much of your worldview, and you firmly believe that when science and religion conflict, religion is always right. \n\nReligion is very important to you, and you believe that its primary meaning is to make sense of life after death, rather than life in this world. You describe your belief in the afterlife as strong, holding a belief in both heaven and hell. Furthermore, you believe that obedience and unselfishness are important qualities for children to learn. However, you do not view tolerance and respect for others as essential virtues for children. This religious devotion extends into your views on governance as well. You believe that a system governed by religious law, with no political parties or elections, would be ideal for your country. You hold that religious authorities interpreting the laws is an absolutely essential characteristic of democracy, as is the duty of people to obey their rulers. \n\nYour political views are fairly conservative. You do not belong to any political party, nor do you participate in any political demonstrations or activism. You disagree that immigration fills important job vacancies, and you believe that strict limits should be placed on the number of foreigners allowed to come to your country. You strongly agree that people who don’t work become lazy and that there should be a strong emphasis on work, even at the cost of spare time. You are strongly against divorce, believing it to be usually unjustified. While you feel that women should have equal opportunities to run for public office, you do not view them as necessarily better political leaders than men. \n\nOn a political scale, you would prefer a strong leader who does not have to bother with parliament or elections, as you believe this could be beneficial for the country. You also feel that having a democratic political system would be good, but it should be shaped by the interpretation of laws by religious authorities. Despite this, you are satisfied with how the political system currently functions in your country. You place a high priority on ensuring the country has strong defense forces and believe that economic growth and job creation should take precedence, even if it harms the environment.\n\nYour confidence in international organizations is relatively high. You have considerable trust in NATO, the World Bank, the United Nations, and the World Health Organization. However, you do not share the same confidence in many other institutions. For example, you do not trust the press or the police, and you feel that there is substantial corruption in both local and state authorities in your country. You also do not have much trust in major companies, banks, or charitable organizations. You are somewhat skeptical about the role of environmental organizations and do not belong to any professional, artistic, or educational associations. \n\nYou have a cautious and somewhat guarded approach toward others. You believe that people frequently have to bribe local officials to get the services they need and that most journalists and media people are involved in corruption. You do not trust people of other nationalities, religions, or races at all, and you would not want to have people from different backgrounds as neighbors. You do not mind people speaking a different language but would not feel comfortable with neighbors who are heavy drinkers, drug addicts, or those with AIDS. \n\nYou hold a relatively critical view of social and political systems. While you do not believe political violence is often justified, you do think that in certain circumstances, it could be rare but still justified. You feel that political violence is generally something to be avoided, but you would be willing to fight for your country in times of war. This could suggest a deep sense of patriotism, but also a belief in the necessity of a strong, secure nation. \n\nRegarding social issues, you believe that women should not earn more than their husbands, as you feel it is almost certain to cause problems in the household. You strongly agree that work should always come first, even if it means sacrificing spare time. You also believe that immigration could lead to increased unemployment, social conflict, and even terrorism. \n\nYou express concern about the possibility of your children not receiving a good education, which is an issue that worries you quite a bit. However, you are generally satisfied with your family’s financial situation and feel secure overall. You rarely go without food, shelter, or medical care, and your family is not typically the victim of crime. You feel that in your country, there is a significant risk of being held accountable for giving or receiving a bribe, which you view as a major problem of corruption. However, you do not consider hard work an essential quality for children to learn, nor do you consider thrift or saving money important qualities. \n\nDespite all this, you maintain a strong bond with your family. You trust them completely, and friends are also very important to you. You describe yourself as rather happy with your life overall and feel that you have considerable freedom to shape your own future. However, you believe that you need to be cautious when dealing with people, suggesting a wariness that comes from your beliefs about corruption and the reliability of others. \n\nOn a more philosophical level, you are worried about the direction of society, believing it must be valiantly defended against any subversive forces. You agree that one of the main goals of life should be to make your parents proud, and you feel a deep sense of loyalty to your country and its way of life. Your sense of identity is closely tied to your country, your religious faith, and your family.",

While religion is not central in your daily activities, you attend religious services on special holy days and consider the basic meaning of religion to be about doing good to others. You also believe that the ultimate purpose of religion is to make sense of life in this world rather than life after death. Your belief in God is strong, and you even find it very important for you to live in a country where religious faith is respected, though you would not consider it a priority for children to learn religious norms.\n\nThough your father was born in country 76 as well, he never had a job, and you never obtained any income from a job yourself. You or your family sometimes went without a cash income in the past year, and at times, you went without enough food to eat or went without needed medicine or medical treatment.

You have 8 children and place a strong emphasis on the importance of family life, often discussing the role of good manners and hard work as important qualities for children to learn. \n\nYou believe in the importance of having a democratic system of governance, but your perspective on democracy is complex.

You would not encourage anyone to take political action online, and you would never organize any political events or protests via the internet. \n\nIn terms of your views on society, you are skeptical of the idea that immigration is beneficial. You disagree that immigration leads to social conflict or fills important job vacancies, and you believe the government should prohibit people from coming to work in this country. At the same time, you believe immigration offers people from poor countries a better life, though you are uncertain whether it leads to increased unemployment or terrorism. You think that when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women, which contrasts with your view that women should have equal rights to run for office. Additionally, you do not mind having people of different religions, races, or nationalities as neighbors, though you would not like to have people who speak a different language or have AIDS as neighbors.\n\nYou feel it is important to keep the government in check, especially regarding surveillance. You strongly believe that the government should not have the right to monitor e-mails, collect information about anyone without their knowledge, or make people’s incomes equal through taxes. You disagree that the government should interfere with private lives, and you do not think the government should tax the rich and subsidize the poor as an essential characteristic of democracy. You also feel it is essential that political leaders are held accountable and that voters are offered a genuine choice during elections. \n\nYou trust people you know personally somewhat but remain cautious when dealing with others, as you believe it is important to be careful. Despite feeling rather secure, you remain wary about the potential for corruption within your country. You strongly believe that there is abundant corruption in your country, particularly within the state authorities, and you think that the rich often buy elections. You are skeptical about the fairness of elections, though you believe that election officials are often fair and that votes are counted fairly. You do not think voters are often threatened with violence or bribed, though you do feel that journalists provide fair coverage of elections.\n\nThough you might join a boycott or donate to a group or campaign, you are not actively involved in any political action, especially online. You do not feel very close to the world at large and have no confidence in the European Union. However, you do feel that a strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with parliament and elections could be beneficial for the country. You are also worried about the risks of a war or civil war involving your country, as well as the potential for another terrorist attack, which you would be concerned about. \n\nAs for your personal goals, you value hard work, determination, and perseverance, though you also believe that success is more about luck and connections than just effort. You consider leisure time to be important, and you do not agree that work should always come first, even if it means less spare time. You believe that competition is harmful, and you are not very interested in technology or its development, thinking that its emphasis could be a bad thing. You strongly believe that scientific advancements create more opportunities for the next generation, and you have no doubt that the world is much better off because of science and technology. Despite all of this, you do not consider being unselfish or having thriftiness as important qualities for children to learn. \n\nYour life today reflects a sense of satisfaction in some areas, especially with how your life has turned out. You feel you have a great deal of choice in your life, and you are completely satisfied with your life overall.

You would, however, be willing to fight for your country in the event of war, and you value having strong defense forces as a priority for your nation in the next decade.\n\nRegarding economic and social issues, you believe that economic growth and job creation should take precedence, even if the environment has to suffer somewhat as a result.

You have never gone without enough food, shelter, or medical treatment in the past year, and while you sometimes went without cash income, your family's basic needs have always been met. You trust your family completely and have a high regard for the importance of family values, but you are also concerned with the financial situation of your household.

You also have quite a lot of confidence in banks and charitable organizations, but not so much in environmental organizations or the European Union.

However, you also see a slight risk in allowing experts to make decisions instead of government representatives. \n\nIn terms of personal safety, you feel secure and have taken measures to protect yourself, such as avoiding carrying much money and not carrying weapons for security reasons. Your trust in local law enforcement and the police is low, but you have confidence in local authorities and rarely encounter corruption in your community.

You believe in the importance of maintaining order in the nation above all else and value a political system governed by democracy, although you are wary of democratic processes, given your perception of corruption in both local and state authorities. You also believe that strict limits should be placed on the number of foreigners allowed to work in the country and that immigration often leads to social conflict, though you recognize that it may provide a better life for people from poor countries.\n\nYour views on society are influenced by your conservative values. For example, you would prefer not to have unmarried couples living together as neighbors, and you are opposed to having people who have AIDS, drug addicts, heavy drinkers, or homosexual couples as neighbors. You believe that women should have equal rights in theory but may cause trouble in practice if they earn more money than their husbands. In your household, gender roles are likely traditional, and you do not mind if a woman stays home as a housewife, viewing it as just as fulfilling as working for pay. \n\nIn your community, you value friends and consider them rather important, although you do not trust many people in general, particularly those of different nationalities or religions. You would not be interested in engaging in online political activities or organizing protests. However, you might attend a peaceful demonstration or sign a petition, and you have encouraged others to vote or take action regarding political matters, even if you are not a member of a political party or self-help group. \n\nWhen it comes to your children, you believe that obedience, thrift, and saving money are not particularly important qualities for them to learn. On the other hand, you hold religious faith, respect for others, and unselfishness as important qualities. You do not value good manners or hard work as important attributes for children to learn, though you strongly agree that having children is a duty toward society. \n\nDespite your skepticism towards much of society and politics, you are confident in many institutions, especially those related to banks, courts, and charitable organizations. You place considerable trust in the World Trade Organization, environmental organizations, and major companies, while expressing a great deal of confidence in the armed forces and police. However, you have little confidence in labor unions, political parties, or the press, and you believe that the media often favors the governing party.\n\nYou have a strong sense of civic duty. You vote regularly in national and local elections and make sure to encourage others to vote as well. You do not consider yourself a revolutionary, but you are of the opinion that society needs radical change, especially when it comes to eliminating corruption, which you believe is widespread in both the local and national government.\n\nYour involvement in organizations is somewhat limited. While you are a member of a church or religious group, you are not actively engaged. You are also a member of an art, music, or educational group, but again, not active. Despite this, you still care deeply about the development of society and believe that the future holds more opportunities for the next generation thanks to advancements in science and technology.\n\nAlthough you do not trust many people, you are deeply attached to your family. You trust your family completely, and family members have been an unwavering support throughout your life. This deep sense of family loyalty and your religious beliefs serve as the foundation for your views on society, politics, and the world.",
    "47820": "You were born in country 417, and your roots are deeply tied to this place. You are male, and your mother, who holds a Master's degree, was also born in this country, while your father, a member of the professional and technical group (e.g., doctor, teacher, engineer), was born in country 417. Growing up, you were shaped by a blend of religious values and national pride, feeling very close to your country, county, region, and even to the world at large. Religion plays an essential role in your life, and you consider yourself a very religious person, attending services more than once a week and praying several times daily. You strongly believe that your religion is the only acceptable one, and when it comes to issues where religion and science conflict, you firmly uphold that religion is always right. For you, the basic meaning of religion is to follow religious norms and ceremonies, and you strongly disagree with the idea of conflicting moral rules in today's world.\n\nWhile you cherish your faith and nationality, you have a complicated relationship with politics. You are not a member of any political party, nor are you affiliated with any professional, self-help, or educational organization. Political matters rarely hold deep significance for you, although you occasionally discuss them with your friends. Despite this, you have very little confidence in the political system in your country, feeling extremely dissatisfied with its current functioning. You believe that votes are not counted fairly very often, and that election officials are rarely fair. You have no confidence in political parties, the press, banks, or the armed forces, and feel that corruption is rampant in your country at every level of authority, from local to state. You believe that rich people often buy elections, and that all state and local authorities are involved in corruption. This gives you little faith in democratic practices, as you strongly oppose having a democratic system in your country. You feel that a government governed by religious law without political parties or elections would be better suited for your country.\n\nYour views on freedom and security are strongly skewed towards freedom, and you would choose it over equality or security any day. You value personal freedom above all, even when it comes at the expense of government control or surveillance. You disagree with the idea of the government having the right to monitor emails or collect information about individuals without their knowledge. However, you do believe that the government should have the right to conduct video surveillance in public areas. When it comes to violence, you firmly oppose it, stating that political violence and stealing are never justified under any circumstances.\n\nDespite your skepticism of government and political systems, you do hold some faith in international organizations. You have quite a lot of confidence in the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank, though your confidence in the IMF, the European Union, and the International Monetary Fund is non-existent. You trust environmental organizations and women’s organizations but hold little to no confidence in labor unions, charitable organizations, or major companies. You see the importance of a stable economy and believe that protecting the environment should be prioritized, even at the cost of slower economic growth and job losses.\n\nYour perspective on societal issues is marked by a desire for structure and order. You strongly believe that maintaining order is the most important goal for your country, and you also feel that having a strong leader who does not have to answer to parliament or elections would be a good way to govern the country. However, you oppose having the army rule as a method of governance. You consider yourself to belong to the lower middle class and are proud of your nationality. Your family is very important to you, and you strongly agree that one of your main goals in life is to make your parents proud.\n\nAlthough you feel that family should come first, you also believe in the importance of education and good manners. However, you do not place significant emphasis on hard work as an essential quality for children, nor do you see it as a duty toward society. You think that more respect for authority and having more say in how things are done at jobs and in communities should be the primary focus for the country in the coming years. You are also open-minded in regard to your neighbors, as long as they do not belong to certain groups. You would not mind having people of different races, languages, or religions living next door, but you are opposed to having people who are heavy drinkers, drug addicts, or have AIDS as neighbors. You are also uncomfortable with having people of different religions, especially if they are not of your own faith, living nearby.\n\nAlthough you place importance on religion, you are wary of certain societal changes, such as the rise of women in leadership roles. While you believe that women should have equal opportunities to run for public office, you do not think women make as good political leaders as men. This extends to your perspective on gender roles—while you agree that women and men should have equal rights, you believe that a woman earning more money than her husband is likely to cause problems in a relationship. You are also of the opinion that homosexual couples are not as suitable as other couples to be parents. In terms of gender equality, you do not believe that a university education is more important for a boy than a girl, and you agree that women and men should have equal rights in all spheres of life.\n\nYou consider yourself quite secure these days and have never gone without food, shelter, or cash income in the last 12 months. You are also highly satisfied with your life overall and feel that you have a great deal of control over your future. Your financial situation is stable, and you believe that your family’s income is adequate. You are not currently worried about losing your job, and you have not been a victim of crime in the past year. In general, you have confidence in the organizations that support environmental, women’s, and religious causes, though your confidence in banks, major companies, and the press is very low.\n\nOverall, your life is guided by a strong sense of religious faith, a commitment to national pride, and a skepticism towards political systems. You value order, freedom, and individual rights, and you do not hesitate to stand firm on your beliefs, especially regarding issues like surveillance, corruption, and societal structure. You have a clear sense of who you are and where you stand on matters of personal faith, political action, and societal organization.",

While you agree that immigration could provide asylum for political refugees, you are concerned about its impact on unemployment and social conflict. You believe that immigration should be controlled, and that strict limits should be placed on the number of foreigners allowed to come to the country for work. You also think that immigration increases the risks of terrorism, although you are open to having immigrants and foreign workers as neighbors.\n\nYou also value individual freedoms, holding that freedom is more important than security or equality. You are not particularly concerned about losing your job or finding a new one, and you feel you have considerable freedom to shape your own future. You strongly believe that democracy must allow people to choose their leaders through free elections, without the influence of religious authorities. \n\nWhen it comes to societal matters, you have a moderate sense of concern about various issues. For instance, you worry greatly about a potential terrorist attack, a civil war, or a war involving your country. You also feel that there is a moderate risk of a breakdown in the moral understanding of right and wrong due to the influence of science and technology, though you recognize that advancements in these fields offer opportunities for future generations. However, you still place more emphasis on the development of technology, believing that it should be a priority for the country.\n\nYou are not a member of any political party, labor union, environmental organization, or any self-help or mutual aid group.

    "27461": "You were born in country 826 and are currently living in your home country with your household members—three people, including yourself. As a male, you consider family and religion extremely important in your life. You attend religious services more than once a week and strongly believe that God is central to your existence (level 10). Your belief in God is accompanied by a firm faith in heaven and hell, both of which are essential to your worldview. You hold religion in such high regard that you consider it crucial for children to learn about religious faith and good manners. While you do belong to another religious denomination, you also strongly disagree that your religion is the only acceptable one. \n\nPolitics plays a significant role in your life as well. You are actively involved in a political party and have a solid interest in political discussions, frequently conversing about politics with friends. You consider yourself an informed individual, often obtaining information about politics and events online, and have signed electronic petitions and participated in boycotts before. You also occasionally attend peaceful demonstrations and might encourage others to take political action online. However, despite your active involvement, you are dissatisfied with how the political system currently functions in your country (level 3). \n\nYou deeply believe in the importance of democracy, valuing the right of the people to choose their leaders in free and fair elections (level 10). You think that living in a country governed democratically is one of the most important aspects of your life (level 9). This belief extends to the notion that honest elections are essential, and you have a great deal of confidence in election fairness and transparency. However, you are wary of corruption in local and state authorities, noting a moderate level of corruption in your country (level 6). \n\nIn terms of your political stance, you trust both NATO and the United Nations, believing that international organizations play important roles in maintaining global stability. Despite this, you have limited faith in political parties and prefer decisions to be made by experts rather than governments, although you still value the role of democratic institutions. You also believe that the government should not monitor citizens' private communications and should not have unlimited access to personal information.\n\nYour views on society are nuanced. You value both freedom and equality, though you would prioritize freedom over equality if forced to choose. You also believe that individual responsibility, with a slight preference for personal freedom (level 6), is key to societal functioning. While you agree that immigration offers people from poorer countries a better life, you believe the government should impose strict limits on the number of foreign workers. Similarly, you agree that immigration helps fill important job vacancies but remain cautious about its potential impact on social stability and conflict. In addition, you think that when jobs are scarce, men should not have more right to a job than women, and you are neutral on whether immigration leads to social conflict.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, you are a staunch advocate for traditional family roles, firmly believing that it is a duty toward society to have children and that women should have equal opportunities in public office. You do not mind having unmarried couples or people of different religions or races as neighbors, but you do believe that a woman's earning more than her husband could cause problems (though you strongly disagree with that notion when it comes to financial matters like tax evasion or bribes). You also do not mind having neighbors with different languages or nationalities, and you are generally not concerned with racial or ethnic differences in your community. \n\nYour views on personal behavior are also quite rigid. You strongly oppose political violence, terrorism, and any form of stealing, while maintaining a firm stance that issues like prostitution, suicide, and tax evasion are never justified. Similarly, you find cheating on taxes, accepting bribes, or engaging in violent behavior completely unacceptable. You strongly believe in the concept of moral integrity and try to teach these values to children, although you do not consider thrift or obedience to be particularly crucial traits for them to learn. \n\nEducation and work are other important factors in your life. You have a Master's degree and belong to a professional group, which suggests that you value education and a well-developed skillset. You are the primary wage earner in your household and have a steady cash income, with no concerns about your ability to secure food, shelter, or medical treatment. Though you do not place much emphasis on hard work as a quality for children to learn, you strongly agree that work is a duty toward society and that a high level of economic growth should be prioritized for the country. You do not believe in any substantial risk of losing your job or not finding one.\n\nWhen it comes to social issues, you are slightly uncomfortable with the idea of religion governing law in the country but support democratic systems with religious freedom. You trust the press and media fairly, though you do not believe TV news or journalists always provide unbiased coverage of elections or politics. Your concerns about society focus on issues such as corruption, economic stability, and a growing respect for authority, though you would also like to see greater emphasis on technological development.\n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in organizations ranging from banks, courts, and humanitarian groups to women's organizations and environmental ones. While you believe environmental protection is important, you are not ready to sacrifice economic growth for it. You do not belong to any environmental groups, though you do value the role they play in society. Similarly, you respect professional organizations and trust banks and companies, though you believe that many large corporations have a fair amount of influence.\n\nIn terms of daily life, you feel secure and satisfied with your personal situation. You are largely content with the financial situation in your household (level 8), and you have a significant degree of control over your life choices (level 7). Your neighborhood is peaceful, with no incidents of crime or corruption, and you feel close to your town and region. You are also somewhat confident in the labor unions, which reflect your broader belief that society should function with a balance of individual responsibility and government action.\n\nLastly, you have a rather optimistic view of the future, even though you are somewhat neutral about whether immigration poses a direct threat to national security. You are confident in the police, military, and courts, which suggests you value law and order. However, you do not see yourself as politically radical; your approach is pragmatic, focused on the preservation of democratic values and a just society.\n\nOverall, you are a person deeply rooted in your religious faith, politically engaged, and committed to family and traditional values. You hold a complex yet balanced view of society, placing importance on both individual freedom and democratic responsibility while remaining cautious about potential threats from social change and political instability.",

You strongly disagree that religion is always right when it conflicts with science, and you believe the basic meaning of religion is to do good to others, rather than simply following religious norms and ceremonies. You also believe that protecting the environment should be prioritized, even if it means slower economic growth or job losses. Although you do not believe in supporting political parties, you do feel strongly about religious faith and its importance, especially for children.\n\nYour views on politics lean toward a preference for stability.

Despite this, you believe in the importance of free elections and feel that votes should be counted fairly, and that having honest elections is essential.\n\nWhile you have moderate confidence in institutions like the World Bank, NATO, and the IMF, your trust in banks, the police, and the courts is limited. You believe the government should monitor all communications over the Internet and collect information about people living in the country without their knowledge, as you feel security is more important than freedom. You also support the idea that the government should have the right to keep people under surveillance in public areas. You trust your neighborhood somewhat, but do not trust people you know very much, and are cautious in your dealings with others.\n\nYour stance on issues related to immigration is nuanced. While you believe immigration fills important job vacancies and offers people from poor countries a better life, you also believe the government should place strict limits on the number of foreigners allowed to work in your country. You disagree that immigration leads to social conflict or increases the risks of terrorism. However, you do believe that when jobs are scarce, men should have more rights to a job than women, and you have some concerns about the impact of immigration on national culture and job availability.\n\nYou are not without concerns about global and local security. You are worried very much about the possibility of a terrorist attack, a civil war, or a war involving your country. You would be willing to fight for your country if it came to that. You are also concerned about the potential dangers of street violence, but fortunately, such violence does not occur in your neighborhood. You avoid carrying much money for security reasons and have never carried a weapon for protection. You do not believe that racial, sexual, or religious discrimination occurs in your neighborhood, and you would not mind having neighbors from different races, religions, or countries. You do not mind if unmarried couples live together or if people of different nationalities, languages, or sexual orientations are your neighbors.\n\nYou believe that the world has both positive and negative impacts due to science and technology. While you recognize that science can create opportunities for the next generation, you also feel there are negative effects, such as the breakdown of moral norms and the potential harms of unchecked technological development. Nonetheless, you view progress in the world as crucial and support the idea of making the world a better place through gradual reforms rather than revolution.\n\nWhen it comes to social issues, you have moderate views. You are not concerned about working less or having less emphasis on work, but you also strongly agree that work is a duty towards society. You somewhat agree that men make better political leaders than women and believe that women should have equal opportunities to run for public office, though you are not certain about the fairness of the political system in your country.

You also believe that women having the same rights as men is an essential characteristic of democracy, and that it is important for people to obey their rulers, though you do not consider democracy’s emphasis on free elections and voters' choice as highly essential.\n\nYour views on crime and justice lean toward moderation. You believe that people should not justify stealing property or committing violence, though you feel that violent behavior is sometimes acceptable. You believe that the justice system should protect individuals' rights and ensure fairness in the rule of law. At the same time, you do not have much confidence in charitable or humanitarian organizations and are skeptical about the press, believing they are often biased and corrupt.\n\nIn terms of your personal relationships, you trust your family completely and consider good manners, tolerance, respect, and obedience important qualities for children to learn. You do not consider hard work or perseverance essential qualities for children to learn, and you are not concerned with the idea of giving your children a good education, although it is a priority for you.\n\nLastly, while you are somewhat satisfied with your life, you would not describe yourself as particularly connected to your continent, region, or town.

You belong to the Roman Catholic denomination and attend religious services weekly, while prayer is a regular part of your routine. You view the basic meaning of religion as doing good for others, rather than adhering strictly to religious norms or ceremonies, and consider religious faith an important quality for children to learn.\n\nAs someone who was raised with a strong religious foundation, you also believe in concepts like hell, heaven, and life after death. Your personal faith is moderately important to you, and you consider yourself a religious person. This spiritual belief heavily influences your views, as you agree that religion should have a place in shaping laws, though you don’t consider religious authorities' ultimate interpretation of laws to be absolutely essential in a democracy. Your beliefs also influence your stance on societal issues, such as your strong opposition to homosexuality, abortion, prostitution, and suicide, which you consider never justified (level 1 on a scale of 1-10).\n\nYou are a female, currently married, and live in a household with three members.

Despite this, you consider the development of technology to be important for future generations and see science and technology as a source of progress.\n\nWhile you have a generally optimistic view of the future, you are concerned about issues like unemployment, the potential for terrorism, and the risks of war or civil unrest. You are particularly worried about a terrorist attack, war involving your country, and the possibility of a civil war. These concerns are compounded by the belief that immigration can lead to social conflict and increase unemployment, though you also recognize that immigration fills important job vacancies.\n\nDespite your concerns, you feel secure in your current life and have never lacked food, shelter, or medical treatment in the past 12 months.

However, you are not someone who would sign a petition or engage in activism unless the cause is particularly compelling. \n\nOn a personal level, you agree with the view that work is a duty toward society, though you also value leisure time. You believe in the importance of voting, and you usually vote in national and local elections, but you feel that the election process is not entirely fair, with the press and wealthy individuals often influencing outcomes. You also consider a democratic country to be vital to your values and feel strongly that women should have the same rights as men in political and societal spheres.\n\nWhile you are not particularly fond of competition, you do see the value of hard work and connections in achieving success, though you believe that a balance between the two is important.

However, you also think that immigration can lead to social conflict and are somewhat uncertain about whether it offers a better life to people from poor countries.

You do not believe the elections in this country are fair or free, with frequent allegations of bribery, voter intimidation, and the prevention of opposition candidates from running. Furthermore, you think that the government is involved in corruption and that the press is biased, often favoring the governing party. \n\nYou have a moderate level of confidence in major companies and the press, as well as in banks, but little confidence in political parties, the courts, and the police.

You disagree with the idea that women are less corrupt than men, and while you agree that women should have equal rights, you also believe that men should sometimes take priority in the workforce when jobs are scarce. \n\nYour political views include the belief that the government should be involved in providing for everyone, but you do not feel that the government's role should be to equalize incomes or provide tax breaks for the wealthy. You are opposed to the idea of a system governed by religious law and dislike the idea of experts making decisions about the country instead of the government.

    "83228": "You were born in country 788 and have always been a proud citizen, feeling a strong connection to both your country and its local community. Growing up, your father belonged to the farm worker group, working as a farm laborer, while your mother had little formal education, perhaps only early childhood schooling. Your family’s situation wasn’t always luxurious, but you never went without food or shelter, and never faced the fear of not having enough income. In fact, both you and your family managed to avoid these hardships for the past 12 months, which you are grateful for. \n\nYou live with your spouse and two children in a household of four. Your spouse, who also comes from a humble background, belongs to the farm worker group and has completed primary education. However, she is currently a housewife and not otherwise employed. Family is incredibly important to you, and despite your lack of trust in your extended family, you still place significant value on the close-knit bond you share with your immediate family.\n\nYou consider yourself to be quite religious, belonging to the Muslim denomination, with your faith playing a crucial role in your daily life. You pray several times a day, attend religious services more than once a week, and deeply believe in the significance of religion in shaping one’s actions and life. For you, the meaning of religion extends beyond rituals—it’s about doing good for others and finding a sense of purpose, particularly in life after death. You strongly agree that your religion is the only acceptable one, and view the concept of hell and heaven as a key part of your belief system. While religion forms a significant part of your worldview, you also believe that obedience and respect for authority are important values to instill in children, alongside hard work, thrift, and unselfishness.\n\nPolitically, you are not a member of any political party and hold a rather critical view of the political landscape. You believe the government should have the right to monitor all emails and other internet communications, and that it’s essential for the state to make people’s incomes more equal, especially through taxing the rich to subsidize the poor. However, you do not have much confidence in political parties, nor in major international organizations like the World Bank, NATO, the United Nations, or the European Union. You feel that political violence is rarely justified, but believe that government elections, while occasionally fair, are often swayed by external influences, such as wealthy individuals buying votes or the governing party influencing the media. In fact, you agree that TV news often favors the governing party. You also believe that voters aren’t always offered a genuine choice, and that election officials tend to be unfair. Yet, despite your skepticism about the electoral process, you always vote in national and local elections, and have even encouraged others to do so. \n\nYou believe in the importance of maintaining order in the nation and consider it the second most crucial goal for your country. However, you would feel strongly opposed to governance led by a single, strong leader without elections or a parliament. You see democracy as a system where people should be allowed to choose their leaders, but you believe it’s also necessary for governments to take responsibility for providing long-term care for their citizens and to offer asylum to political refugees. That said, you feel that democracy isn’t perfect in your country, and that the importance of equal opportunities for women in running for public office is somewhat overemphasized. \n\nThough you believe that people from other countries should be allowed to work here if there are available jobs, you do not trust people of different nationalities or religions much. Additionally, while you feel it would be bad for the country to be governed solely by religious law, you have no problem with having unmarried couples or people of different religions as neighbors. However, you do feel that racial discrimination is frequent in your neighborhood, and that people like you often have to deal with corruption in dealing with local authorities.\n\nYou feel a strong sense of pride in your nationality, and even when it comes to global matters, you believe your region and continent are important to you. Despite this, you are not very close to the wider world and feel you must be very cautious in dealing with people, especially those from different backgrounds.

You don't worry much about losing your job or not finding another, and you are not particularly concerned about your family's financial situation. You place little emphasis on leisure time, and instead, consider hard work a duty to society. While you agree that men should have more rights to jobs than women when employment is scarce, you also believe in equality to some extent, especially when it comes to offering a better life for people from poorer countries through immigration.\n\nRegarding social issues, you are not particularly supportive of political activism and would never attend a peaceful demonstration. You also disagree with boycotts or other forms of political protest. However, you do believe that competition in society is somewhat harmful, although you see its benefits. You hold a rather neutral stance toward society, feeling that it should be gradually improved by reforms, but not drastically altered. You also don’t mind having people of a different race, religion, or language as neighbors, but you have a deep-rooted belief that some moral rules are difficult to follow and that, at times, decisions based on those rules can be confusing.\n\nFinally, your commitment to your family and your religion is a driving force in your life. Despite the challenges, you strongly believe in making your parents proud and upholding traditional values such as respect, obedience, and hard work. While you are not overly concerned with societal changes or technological advancements, you do see the importance of a well-structured, orderly society that emphasizes responsibility and perseverance.",

You also do not believe in hell, heaven, or life after death. You strongly disagree that religion is always right when it conflicts with science and are not concerned with the idea of religious faith being an essential quality for children to learn. \n\nLeisure time is very important to you, and you think it would be beneficial if there was less importance placed on work in society.

You also have confidence in banks, labor unions, and charitable organizations. However, you hold a rather low level of trust in political parties, the police, the courts, and the media, which you feel rarely provide fair coverage of elections. This lack of trust extends to the government, which you believe should have the right to monitor e-mails and other information exchanged on the internet, as well as to collect information on individuals without their knowledge. However, you would also support the idea of experts, not the government, making decisions for the country. Despite your mixed views about competition, with a slight inclination toward seeing it as good, you believe that government should still play an essential role, especially in managing social welfare, as you slightly favor government responsibility over individual responsibility.\n\nAs someone who is politically aware, you occasionally discuss political matters with friends and might sign petitions or participate in peaceful demonstrations.

You do not belong to any political party, and you are neutral about whether it is essential for a democracy to ensure equal rights for men and women, or if the state should make people's incomes equal. You also feel neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning in your country today. You do not have much confidence in elections, especially regarding vote fairness, and you also suspect that political violence, corruption, and voter intimidation may affect the integrity of elections. Additionally, you are neutral about the role of government in regulating individual actions and decisions, such as whether there should be a strong leader who does not have to deal with parliament or elections, or whether experts should make decisions rather than elected officials. \n\nIn terms of your economic beliefs, you value a high level of economic growth as the top priority for the country in the next decade, but you also believe maintaining order in the nation is the second most important goal. You believe that economic growth and job creation are more important than the environment, though you do support sustainable development to some extent. You are somewhat dissatisfied with your current life situation and feel insecure, especially when it comes to your household's financial stability and job security. However, you are proud to be from your country and feel connected to it, even if you're uncertain about your level of happiness or satisfaction with your life as a whole.\n\nYour personal beliefs show a mixture of traditional and progressive ideas.

You are also deeply worried about issues like terrorism and civil war and express anxiety over the possibility of losing your job. Furthermore, you are concerned that social media and the internet are unreliable sources of information, even though you obtain information from these sources regularly. \n\nIn terms of your personal life, you avoid carrying money for security reasons and do not mind having neighbors from different religions, races, or nationalities. You are not concerned about the idea of immigrants or foreign workers living in your neighborhood, and you are open to having unmarried couples or people with AIDS as neighbors.

Your father worked in a sales-related role, just like your spouse, who is involved in the sales group, either as a sales manager, shop owner, or a similar occupation. You and your spouse have two children together, and you live as a family of four in your current household. \n\nFamily holds great importance to you, and you consider it central to your life. You strongly believe that one of your main goals in life has been to make your parents proud. You are the chief wage earner in your household, and work or have worked for a private business or industry. Despite your busy professional life, you make it a point to attend religious services once a week, and consider yourself a deeply religious person. God is very important to you, and you believe in Him with utmost conviction (level 10 on a scale of 1-10). Religion plays a central role in your life, shaping both your moral compass and your perspective on societal issues. You belong to the Muslim denomination, and firmly believe that your religion is the only acceptable one. \n\nAlthough family is crucial, friends are not particularly significant to you. You do not mind having people of different religions, races, or nationalities as neighbors, but you are clear in your belief that you do not trust people of another religion or nationality at all. Trusting others is something you are cautious about, as you generally believe that you must be very careful when dealing with people. Your belief system is rooted in the idea that people should strive to do good for others, rather than merely following religious norms or ceremonies. Your religious outlook emphasizes practical goodness over doctrinal adherence.\n\nYou have quite a lot of confidence in international organizations such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and the European Union. You also believe that banks, charitable organizations, and major companies are trustworthy. On a similar note, you hold strong confidence in institutions like the police and the courts. At the same time, you strongly believe that the government should have the authority to monitor emails, collect information about its citizens without their knowledge, and keep people under video surveillance in public areas. This belief in government control extends to your acceptance of political surveillance in the name of security, showing a clear preference for the protection of national security over personal privacy. \n\nYour views on democracy are mixed, though. You think a democratic political system is a fairly good way to govern the country, but you would also not mind if there were a system governed by religious law or if a strong leader were in charge without the need for parliamentary elections. You are not very active in your political party but do belong to one, and you believe that voting is an essential practice for selecting leaders. You always vote in both national and local elections, and while you believe that votes are often counted fairly, you do not have much faith in the overall political system. You think the government should be responsible for ensuring everyone is provided for, and while you don’t believe in political violence, you would be willing to fight for your country if necessary.\n\nWhen it comes to societal issues, you hold conservative views. You believe that women do not have equal opportunities to run for public office, and you disagree with the idea of unmarried couples living together. You would not like to have homosexual couples as neighbors, and you believe that homosexuality is never justified (level 1 on a scale of 1-10). You feel that women earning more money than their husbands is almost certain to cause problems, and you believe that men generally make better political leaders than women. Additionally, you think it is important for children to learn qualities like hard work and perseverance, but you do not consider tolerance, respect for others, or religious faith as essential qualities for children to learn. \n\nYou also hold some concerns about the state of your country. You believe that the country is suffering from corruption at the highest levels, and that most of the state authorities are involved in it. You strongly believe that a high level of corruption exists in the country (level 10 on a scale of 1-10). As a result, you hold a deep skepticism toward political parties and feel dissatisfied with how the political system is functioning. You are not particularly happy with the financial situation of your household, nor do you feel a great deal of optimism about your future. You worry about not being able to give your children a good education and the possibility of losing your job.\n\nRegarding immigration, you are against it to a certain extent. You believe the government should place strict limits on the number of foreigners allowed to work in the country, and you think immigration often increases unemployment. However, you also believe that immigration offers people from poor countries a better life and that asylum should be granted to political refugees. You are concerned that immigration might increase the risks of terrorism and that it may lead to social conflict. Still, you don’t mind having immigrants or foreign workers as neighbors, though you would not want to have drug addicts, heavy drinkers, or people with AIDS as neighbors.\n\nWhile you are relatively secure these days, you do not feel particularly close to your country, continent, or the world. You believe that individual human rights are not respected enough in your country, and you feel that people are often unsure about which moral rules to follow. This feeling is exacerbated by your distrust of others, as you believe that you rarely have control over how your life turns out, and that you have no choice in the matter.\n\nDespite these concerns, you are quite satisfied with your life as a whole and feel fairly secure in your current situation. You trust your family completely and have a high level of confidence in them. You also trust your neighborhood, but remain vigilant about the potential risks posed by corruption, politics, and societal issues.\n\nIn summary, your worldview is shaped by a mixture of religious devotion, cautious trust in authorities, and a preference for security over freedom. You value family and tradition but have concerns about the direction in which your country is headed, especially regarding political corruption and immigration. While you are somewhat skeptical of the effectiveness of democratic governance, you believe in the importance of voting and the role of the government in ensuring social security."
